            <p>
                                1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:

                                2 for gaining wisdom and instruction;
                                    for understanding words of insight;
                                3 for receiving instruction in prudent behavior,
                                    doing what is right and just and fair;
                                4 for giving prudence to those who are simple,[a]
                                    knowledge and discretion to the young—
                                5 let the wise listen and add to their learning,
                                    and let the discerning get guidance—
                                6 for understanding proverbs and parables,
                                    the sayings and riddles of the wise.

                                7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,
                                    but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

                                Prologue: Exhortations to Embrace Wisdom
                                Warning Against the Invitation of Sinful Men
                                8 Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction
                                    and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
                                9 They are a garland to grace your head
                                    and a chain to adorn your neck.

                                10 My son, if sinful men entice you,
                                    do not give in to them.
                                11 If they say, “Come along with us;
                                    let’s lie in wait for innocent blood,
                                    let’s ambush some harmless soul;
                                12 let’s swallow them alive, like the grave,
                                    and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
                                13 we will get all sorts of valuable things
                                    and fill our houses with plunder;
                                14 cast lots with us;
                                    we will all share the loot”—
                                15 my son, do not go along with them,
                                    do not set foot on their paths;
                                16 for their feet rush into evil,
                                    they are swift to shed blood.
                                17 How useless to spread a net
                                    where every bird can see it!
                                18 These men lie in wait for their own blood;
                                    they ambush only themselves!
                                19 Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain;
                                    it takes away the life of those who get it.

                                Wisdom’s Rebuke
                                20 Out in the open wisdom calls aloud,
                                    she raises her voice in the public square;
                                21 on top of the wall she cries out,
                                    at the city gate she makes her speech:

                                22 “How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?
                                    How long will mockers delight in mockery
                                    and fools hate knowledge?
                                23 Repent at my rebuke!
                                    Then I will pour out my thoughts to you,
                                    I will make known to you my teachings.
                                24 But since you refuse to listen when I call
                                    and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,
                                25 since you disregard all my advice
                                    and do not accept my rebuke,
                                26 I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you;
                                    I will mock when calamity overtakes you—
                                27 when calamity overtakes you like a storm,
                                    when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,
                                    when distress and trouble overwhelm you.

                                28 “Then they will call to me but I will not answer;
                                    they will look for me but will not find me,
                                29 since they hated knowledge
                                    and did not choose to fear the Lord.
                                30 Since they would not accept my advice
                                    and spurned my rebuke,
                                31 they will eat the fruit of their ways
                                    and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
                                32 For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,
                                    and the complacency of fools will destroy them;
                                33 but whoever listens to me will live in safety
                                    and be at ease, without fear of harm.”

            <p>
                                           Moral Benefits of Wisdom
                                2 My son, if you accept my words
                                    and store up my commands within you,
                                2 turning your ear to wisdom
                                    and applying your heart to understanding—
                                3 indeed, if you call out for insight
                                    and cry aloud for understanding,
                                4 and if you look for it as for silver
                                    and search for it as for hidden treasure,
                                5 then you will understand the fear of the Lord
                                    and find the knowledge of God.
                                6 For the Lord gives wisdom;
                                    from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
                                7 He holds success in store for the upright,
                                    he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,
                                8 for he guards the course of the just
                                    and protects the way of his faithful ones.

                                9 Then you will understand what is right and just
                                    and fair—every good path.
                                10 For wisdom will enter your heart,
                                    and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
                                11 Discretion will protect you,
                                    and understanding will guard you.

                                12 Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men,
                                    from men whose words are perverse,
                                13 who have left the straight paths
                                    to walk in dark ways,
                                14 who delight in doing wrong
                                    and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,
                                15 whose paths are crooked
                                    and who are devious in their ways.

                                16 Wisdom will save you also from the adulterous woman,
                                    from the wayward woman with her seductive words,
                                17 who has left the partner of her youth
                                    and ignored the covenant she made before God.[a]
                                18 Surely her house leads down to death
                                    and her paths to the spirits of the dead.
                                19 None who go to her return
                                    or attain the paths of life.

                                20 Thus you will walk in the ways of the good
                                    and keep to the paths of the righteous.
                                21 For the upright will live in the land,
                                    and the blameless will remain in it;
                                22 but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
                                    and the unfaithful will be torn from it.

                                            Wisdom Bestows Well-Being
                              3 My son, do not forget my teaching,
                                  but keep my commands in your heart,
                              2 for they will prolong your life many years
                                  and bring you peace and prosperity.

                              3 Let love and faithfulness never leave you;
                                  bind them around your neck,
                                  write them on the tablet of your heart.

                                  in the sight of God and man.

                              5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart
                                  and lean not on your own understanding;
                              6 in all your ways submit to him,
                                  and he will make your paths straight.[a]

                              7 Do not be wise in your own eyes;
                                  fear the Lord and shun evil.
                              8 This will bring health to your body
                                  and nourishment to your bones.

                              9 Honor the Lord with your wealth,
                                  with the firstfruits of all your crops;
                              10 then your barns will be filled to overflowing,
                                  and your vats will brim over with new wine.

                              11 My son, do not despise the Lord’s discipline,
                                  and do not resent his rebuke,
                              12 because the Lord disciplines those he loves,
                                  as a father the son he delights in.[b]

                              13 Blessed are those who find wisdom,
                                  those who gain understanding,
                              14 for she is more profitable than silver
                                  and yields better returns than gold.
                              15 She is more precious than rubies;
                                  nothing you desire can compare with her.
                              16 Long life is in her right hand;
                                  in her left hand are riches and honor.
                              17 Her ways are pleasant ways,
                                  and all her paths are peace.
                              18 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her;
                                  those who hold her fast will be blessed.

                              19 By wisdom the Lord laid the earth’s foundations,
                                  by understanding he set the heavens in place;
                              20 by his knowledge the watery depths were divided,
                                  and the clouds let drop the dew.

                              21 My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight,
                                  preserve sound judgment and discretion;
                              22 they will be life for you,
                                  an ornament to grace your neck.
                              23 Then you will go on your way in safety,
                                  and your foot will not stumble.
                              24 When you lie down, you will not be afraid;
                                  when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
                              25 Have no fear of sudden disaster
                                  or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
                              26 for the Lord will be at your side
                                  and will keep your foot from being snared.

                              27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
                                  when it is in your power to act.
                              28 Do not say to your neighbor,
                                  “Come back tomorrow and I’ll give it to you”—
                                  when you already have it with you.
                              29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor,
                                  who lives trustfully near you.
                              30 Do not accuse anyone for no reason—
                                  when they have done you no harm.

                              31 Do not envy the violent
                                  or choose any of their ways.

                              32 For the Lord detests the perverse
                                  but takes the upright into his confidence.
                              33 The Lord’s curse is on the house of the wicked,
                                  but he blesses the home of the righteous.
                              34 He mocks proud mockers
                                  but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.
                              35 The wise inherit honor,
                                  but fools get only shame.

             <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs IV &darr;</h2>
            <p>
            4 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. 2 Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. 3 They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. 4 For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 5 because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.

6 If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters,[a] you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished on the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed. 7 Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives’ tales; rather, train yourself to be godly. 8 For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. 9 This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance. 10 That is why we labor and strive, because we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.

11 Command and teach these things. 12 Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity. 13 Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching. 14 Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.

15 Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. 16 Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.

            <p>
            Widows, Elders and Slaves
5 Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, 2 older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.

3 Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. 4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. 5 The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. 6 But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. 7 Give the people these instructions, so that no one may be open to blame. 8 Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

9 No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, 10 and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.

11 As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. 12 Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. 13 Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also busybodies who talk nonsense, saying things they ought not to. 14 So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. 15 Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.

16 If any woman who is a believer has widows in her care, she should continue to help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.

17 The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. 18 For Scripture says, “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,”[a] and “The worker deserves his wages.”[b] 19 Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. 20 But those elders who are sinning you are to reprove before everyone, so that the others may take warning. 21 I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism.

22 Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.

23 Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.

24 The sins of some are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them. 25 In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden forever.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs VI &darr;</h2>
            <p>
            6 All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God’s name and our teaching may not be slandered. 2 Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare[a] of their slaves.

False Teachers and the Love of Money
These are the things you are to teach and insist on. 3 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 4 they are conceited and understand nothing. They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions 5 and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.

6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. 8 But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. 9 Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.

Final Charge to Timothy
11 But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 13 In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you 14 to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 which God will bring about in his own time—God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16 who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.

17 Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. 18 Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. 19 In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.

20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge, 21 which some have professed and in so doing have departed from the faith.

Grace be with you all.
