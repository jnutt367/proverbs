            <p>
                                1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:

                                2 for gaining wisdom and instruction;
                                    for understanding words of insight;
                                3 for receiving instruction in prudent behavior,
                                    doing what is right and just and fair;
                                4 for giving prudence to those who are simple,[a]
                                    knowledge and discretion to the young—
                                5 let the wise listen and add to their learning,
                                    and let the discerning get guidance—
                                6 for understanding proverbs and parables,
                                    the sayings and riddles of the wise.

                                7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,
                                    but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

                                Prologue: Exhortations to Embrace Wisdom
                                Warning Against the Invitation of Sinful Men
                                8 Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction
                                    and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
                                9 They are a garland to grace your head
                                    and a chain to adorn your neck.

                                10 My son, if sinful men entice you,
                                    do not give in to them.
                                11 If they say, “Come along with us;
                                    let’s lie in wait for innocent blood,
                                    let’s ambush some harmless soul;
                                12 let’s swallow them alive, like the grave,
                                    and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
                                13 we will get all sorts of valuable things
                                    and fill our houses with plunder;
                                14 cast lots with us;
                                    we will all share the loot”—
                                15 my son, do not go along with them,
                                    do not set foot on their paths;
                                16 for their feet rush into evil,
                                    they are swift to shed blood.
                                17 How useless to spread a net
                                    where every bird can see it!
                                18 These men lie in wait for their own blood;
                                    they ambush only themselves!
                                19 Such are the paths of all who go after ill-gotten gain;
                                    it takes away the life of those who get it.

                                Wisdom’s Rebuke
                                20 Out in the open wisdom calls aloud,
                                    she raises her voice in the public square;
                                21 on top of the wall she cries out,
                                    at the city gate she makes her speech:

                                22 “How long will you who are simple love your simple ways?
                                    How long will mockers delight in mockery
                                    and fools hate knowledge?
                                23 Repent at my rebuke!
                                    Then I will pour out my thoughts to you,
                                    I will make known to you my teachings.
                                24 But since you refuse to listen when I call
                                    and no one pays attention when I stretch out my hand,
                                25 since you disregard all my advice
                                    and do not accept my rebuke,
                                26 I in turn will laugh when disaster strikes you;
                                    I will mock when calamity overtakes you—
                                27 when calamity overtakes you like a storm,
                                    when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind,
                                    when distress and trouble overwhelm you.

                                28 “Then they will call to me but I will not answer;
                                    they will look for me but will not find me,
                                29 since they hated knowledge
                                    and did not choose to fear the Lord.
                                30 Since they would not accept my advice
                                    and spurned my rebuke,
                                31 they will eat the fruit of their ways
                                    and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
                                32 For the waywardness of the simple will kill them,
                                    and the complacency of fools will destroy them;
                                33 but whoever listens to me will live in safety
                                    and be at ease, without fear of harm.”

            <p>
                                           Moral Benefits of Wisdom
                                2 My son, if you accept my words
                                    and store up my commands within you,
                                2 turning your ear to wisdom
                                    and applying your heart to understanding—
                                3 indeed, if you call out for insight
                                    and cry aloud for understanding,
                                4 and if you look for it as for silver
                                    and search for it as for hidden treasure,
                                5 then you will understand the fear of the Lord
                                    and find the knowledge of God.
                                6 For the Lord gives wisdom;
                                    from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
                                7 He holds success in store for the upright,
                                    he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,
                                8 for he guards the course of the just
                                    and protects the way of his faithful ones.

                                9 Then you will understand what is right and just
                                    and fair—every good path.
                                10 For wisdom will enter your heart,
                                    and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
                                11 Discretion will protect you,
                                    and understanding will guard you.

                                12 Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men,
                                    from men whose words are perverse,
                                13 who have left the straight paths
                                    to walk in dark ways,
                                14 who delight in doing wrong
                                    and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,
                                15 whose paths are crooked
                                    and who are devious in their ways.

                                16 Wisdom will save you also from the adulterous woman,
                                    from the wayward woman with her seductive words,
                                17 who has left the partner of her youth
                                    and ignored the covenant she made before God.[a]
                                18 Surely her house leads down to death
                                    and her paths to the spirits of the dead.
                                19 None who go to her return
                                    or attain the paths of life.

                                20 Thus you will walk in the ways of the good
                                    and keep to the paths of the righteous.
                                21 For the upright will live in the land,
                                    and the blameless will remain in it;
                                22 but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
                                    and the unfaithful will be torn from it.

                              3 My son, do not forget my teaching,
                                  but keep my commands in your heart,
                              2 for they will prolong your life many years
                                  and bring you peace and prosperity.

                              3 Let love and faithfulness never leave you;
                                  bind them around your neck,

                                  in the sight of God and man.

                              5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart
                                  and lean not on your own understanding;
                              6 in all your ways submit to him,
                                  and he will make your paths straight.[a]

                              7 Do not be wise in your own eyes;
                                  fear the Lord and shun evil.
                              8 This will bring health to your body
                                  and nourishment to your bones.

                              9 Honor the Lord with your wealth,
                                  with the firstfruits of all your crops;
                              10 then your barns will be filled to overflowing,
                                  and your vats will brim over with new wine.

                              11 My son, do not despise the Lord’s discipline,
                                  and do not resent his rebuke,
                              12 because the Lord disciplines those he loves,
                                  as a father the son he delights in.[b]

                              13 Blessed are those who find wisdom,
                                  those who gain understanding,
                              14 for she is more profitable than silver
                                  and yields better returns than gold.
                              15 She is more precious than rubies;
                                  nothing you desire can compare with her.
                              16 Long life is in her right hand;
                                  in her left hand are riches and honor.
                              17 Her ways are pleasant ways,
                                  and all her paths are peace.
                              18 She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her;
                                  those who hold her fast will be blessed.

                              19 By wisdom the Lord laid the earth’s foundations,
                                  by understanding he set the heavens in place;
                              20 by his knowledge the watery depths were divided,
                                  and the clouds let drop the dew.

                              21 My son, do not let wisdom and understanding out of your sight,
                                  preserve sound judgment and discretion;
                              22 they will be life for you,
                                  an ornament to grace your neck.
                              23 Then you will go on your way in safety,
                                  and your foot will not stumble.
                              24 When you lie down, you will not be afraid;
                                  when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
                              25 Have no fear of sudden disaster
                                  or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
                              26 for the Lord will be at your side
                                  and will keep your foot from being snared.

                              27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
                                  when it is in your power to act.
                              28 Do not say to your neighbor,
                                  “Come back tomorrow and I’ll give it to you”—
                                  when you already have it with you.
                              29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor,
                                  who lives trustfully near you.
                              30 Do not accuse anyone for no reason—
                                  when they have done you no harm.

                              31 Do not envy the violent
                                  or choose any of their ways.

                              32 For the Lord detests the perverse
                                  but takes the upright into his confidence.
                              33 The Lord’s curse is on the house of the wicked,
                                  but he blesses the home of the righteous.
                              34 He mocks proud mockers
                                  but shows favor to the humble and oppressed.
                              35 The wise inherit honor,
                                  but fools get only shame.

            <p>
                                               Get Wisdom at Any Cost
                                    4 Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction;
                                        pay attention and gain understanding.
                                    2 I give you sound learning,
                                        so do not forsake my teaching.
                                    3 For I too was a son to my father,
                                        still tender, and cherished by my mother.
                                    4 Then he taught me, and he said to me,
                                        “Take hold of my words with all your heart;
                                        keep my commands, and you will live.
                                    5 Get wisdom, get understanding;
                                        do not forget my words or turn away from them.
                                    6 Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you;
                                        love her, and she will watch over you.
                                    7 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get[a] wisdom.
                                        Though it cost all you have,[b] get understanding.
                                    8 Cherish her, and she will exalt you;
                                        embrace her, and she will honor you.
                                    9 She will give you a garland to grace your head
                                        and present you with a glorious crown.”

                                    10 Listen, my son, accept what I say,
                                        and the years of your life will be many.
                                    11 I instruct you in the way of wisdom
                                        and lead you along straight paths.
                                    12 When you walk, your steps will not be hampered;
                                        when you run, you will not stumble.
                                    13 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go;
                                        guard it well, for it is your life.
                                    14 Do not set foot on the path of the wicked
                                        or walk in the way of evildoers.
                                    15 Avoid it, do not travel on it;
                                        turn from it and go on your way.
                                    16 For they cannot rest until they do evil;
                                        they are robbed of sleep till they make someone stumble.
                                    17 They eat the bread of wickedness
                                        and drink the wine of violence.

                                    18 The path of the righteous is like the morning sun,
                                        shining ever brighter till the full light of day.
                                    19 But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness;
                                        they do not know what makes them stumble.

                                    20 My son, pay attention to what I say;
                                        turn your ear to my words.
                                    21 Do not let them out of your sight,
                                        keep them within your heart;
                                    22 for they are life to those who find them
                                        and health to one’s whole body.
                                    23 Above all else, guard your heart,
                                        for everything you do flows from it.
                                    24 Keep your mouth free of perversity;
                                        keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
                                    25 Let your eyes look straight ahead;
                                        fix your gaze directly before you.
                                    26 Give careful thought to the[c] paths for your feet
                                        and be steadfast in all your ways.
                                    27 Do not turn to the right or the left;
                                        keep your foot from evil.

                                                                  Warning Against Adultery
                                 My son, pay attention to my wisdom,
                                    turn your ear to my words of insight,
                                2 that you may maintain discretion
                                    and your lips may preserve knowledge.
                                3 For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey,
                                    and her speech is smoother than oil;
                                4 but in the end she is bitter as gall,
                                    sharp as a double-edged sword.
                                5 Her feet go down to death;
                                    her steps lead straight to the grave.
                                6 She gives no thought to the way of life;
                                    her paths wander aimlessly, but she does not know it.

                                7 Now then, my sons, listen to me;
                                    do not turn aside from what I say.
                                8 Keep to a path far from her,
                                    do not go near the door of her house,
                                9 lest you lose your honor to others
                                    and your dignity[a] to one who is cruel,
                                10 lest strangers feast on your wealth
                                    and your toil enrich the house of another.
                                11 At the end of your life you will groan,
                                    when your flesh and body are spent.
                                12 You will say, “How I hated discipline!
                                    How my heart spurned correction!
                                13 I would not obey my teachers
                                    or turn my ear to my instructors.
                                14 And I was soon in serious trouble
                                    in the assembly of God’s people.”

                                15 Drink water from your own cistern,
                                    running water from your own well.
                                16 Should your springs overflow in the streets,
                                    your streams of water in the public squares?
                                17 Let them be yours alone,
                                    never to be shared with strangers.
                                18 May your fountain be blessed,
                                    and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.
                                19 A loving doe, a graceful deer—
                                    may her breasts satisfy you always,
                                    may you ever be intoxicated with her love.
                                20 Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife?
                                    Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?

                                21 For your ways are in full view of the Lord,
                                    and he examines all your paths.
                                22 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them;
                                    the cords of their sins hold them fast.
                                23 For lack of discipline they will die,
                                    led astray by their own great folly.

                                            Warnings Against Folly
                                6 My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor,
                                    if you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,
                                2 you have been trapped by what you said,
                                    ensnared by the words of your mouth.
                                3 So do this, my son, to free yourself,
                                    since you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands:
                                Go—to the point of exhaustion—[a]
                                    and give your neighbor no rest!
                                4 Allow no sleep to your eyes,
                                    no slumber to your eyelids.
                                5 Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
                                    like a bird from the snare of the fowler.

                                6 Go to the ant, you sluggard;
                                    consider its ways and be wise!
                                7 It has no commander,
                                    no overseer or ruler,
                                8 yet it stores its provisions in summer
                                    and gathers its food at harvest.

                                9 How long will you lie there, you sluggard?
                                    When will you get up from your sleep?
                                10 A little sleep, a little slumber,
                                    a little folding of the hands to rest—
                                11 and poverty will come on you like a thief
                                    and scarcity like an armed man.

                                12 A troublemaker and a villain,
                                    who goes about with a corrupt mouth,
                                13     who winks maliciously with his eye,
                                    signals with his feet
                                    and motions with his fingers,
                                14     who plots evil with deceit in his heart—
                                    he always stirs up conflict.
                                15 Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant;
                                    he will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.

                                16 There are six things the Lord hates,
                                    seven that are detestable to him:
                                17         haughty eyes,
                                        a lying tongue,
                                        hands that shed innocent blood,
                                18         a heart that devises wicked schemes,
                                        feet that are quick to rush into evil,
                                19         a false witness who pours out lies
                                        and a person who stirs up conflict in the community.

                                Warning Against Adultery
                                20 My son, keep your father’s command
                                    and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
                                21 Bind them always on your heart;
                                    fasten them around your neck.
                                22 When you walk, they will guide you;
                                    when you sleep, they will watch over you;
                                    when you awake, they will speak to you.
                                23 For this command is a lamp,
                                    this teaching is a light,
                                and correction and instruction
                                    are the way to life,
                                24 keeping you from your neighbor’s wife,
                                    from the smooth talk of a wayward woman.

                                25 Do not lust in your heart after her beauty
                                    or let her captivate you with her eyes.

                                26 For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread,
                                    but another man’s wife preys on your very life.
                                27 Can a man scoop fire into his lap
                                    without his clothes being burned?
                                28 Can a man walk on hot coals
                                    without his feet being scorched?
                                29 So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife;
                                    no one who touches her will go unpunished.

                                30 People do not despise a thief if he steals
                                    to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.
                                31 Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold,
                                    though it costs him all the wealth of his house.
                                32 But a man who commits adultery has no sense;
                                    whoever does so destroys himself.
                                33 Blows and disgrace are his lot,
                                    and his shame will never be wiped away.

                                34 For jealousy arouses a husband’s fury,
                                    and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
                                35 He will not accept any compensation;
                                    he will refuse a bribe, however great it is.

            <p>
                                  Warning Against the Adulterous Woman
                                  7 My son, keep my words
                                      and store up my commands within you.
                                  2 Keep my commands and you will live;
                                      guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.
                                  3 Bind them on your fingers;
                                      write them on the tablet of your heart.
                                  4 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
                                      and to insight, “You are my relative.”
                                  5 They will keep you from the adulterous woman,
                                      from the wayward woman with her seductive words.

                                  6 At the window of my house
                                      I looked down through the lattice.
                                  7 I saw among the simple,
                                      I noticed among the young men,
                                      a youth who had no sense.
                                  8 He was going down the street near her corner,
                                      walking along in the direction of her house
                                  9 at twilight, as the day was fading,
                                      as the dark of night set in.

                                  10 Then out came a woman to meet him,
                                      dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.
                                  11 (She is unruly and defiant,
                                      her feet never stay at home;
                                  12 now in the street, now in the squares,
                                      at every corner she lurks.)
                                  13 She took hold of him and kissed him
                                      and with a brazen face she said:

                                  14 “Today I fulfilled my vows,
                                      and I have food from my fellowship offering at home.
                                  15 So I came out to meet you;
                                      I looked for you and have found you!
                                  16 I have covered my bed
                                      with colored linens from Egypt.
                                  17 I have perfumed my bed
                                      with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
                                  18 Come, let’s drink deeply of love till morning;
                                      let’s enjoy ourselves with love!
                                  19 My husband is not at home;
                                      he has gone on a long journey.
                                  20 He took his purse filled with money
                                      and will not be home till full moon.”

                                  21 With persuasive words she led him astray;
                                      she seduced him with her smooth talk.
                                  22 All at once he followed her
                                      like an ox going to the slaughter,
                                  like a deer[a] stepping into a noose[b]
                                  23     till an arrow pierces his liver,
                                  like a bird darting into a snare,
                                      little knowing it will cost him his life.

                                  24 Now then, my sons, listen to me;
                                      pay attention to what I say.
                                  25 Do not let your heart turn to her ways
                                      or stray into her paths.
                                  26 Many are the victims she has brought down;
                                      her slain are a mighty throng.
                                  27 Her house is a highway to the grave,
                                      leading down to the chambers of death.

                                          Wisdom’s Call
                                          8 Does not wisdom call out?
                                              Does not understanding raise her voice?
                                          2 At the highest point along the way,
                                              where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
                                          3 beside the gate leading into the city,
                                              at the entrance, she cries aloud:
                                          4 “To you, O people, I call out;
                                              I raise my voice to all mankind.
                                          5 You who are simple, gain prudence;
                                              you who are foolish, set your hearts on it.[a]
                                          6 Listen, for I have trustworthy things to say;
                                              I open my lips to speak what is right.
                                          7 My mouth speaks what is true,
                                              for my lips detest wickedness.
                                          8 All the words of my mouth are just;
                                              none of them is crooked or perverse.
                                          9 To the discerning all of them are right;
                                              they are upright to those who have found knowledge.
                                          10 Choose my instruction instead of silver,
                                              knowledge rather than choice gold,
                                          11 for wisdom is more precious than rubies,
                                              and nothing you desire can compare with her.

                                          12 “I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence;
                                              I possess knowledge and discretion.
                                          13 To fear the Lord is to hate evil;

                                              and rulers issue decrees that are just;

                                              and nobles—all who rule on earth.[b]
                                          17 I love those who love me,
                                              and those who seek me find me.
                                          18 With me are riches and honor,
                                              enduring wealth and prosperity.
                                          19 My fruit is better than fine gold;
                                              what I yield surpasses choice silver.
                                          20 I walk in the way of righteousness,
                                              along the paths of justice,
                                          21 bestowing a rich inheritance on those who love me
                                              and making their treasuries full.

                                          22 “The Lord brought me forth as the first of his works,[c][d]
                                              before his deeds of old;
                                          23 I was formed long ages ago,
                                              at the very beginning, when the world came to be.
                                          24 When there were no watery depths, I was given birth,
                                              when there were no springs overflowing with water;
                                          25 before the mountains were settled in place,
                                              before the hills, I was given birth,
                                          26 before he made the world or its fields
                                              or any of the dust of the earth.
                                          27 I was there when he set the heavens in place,
                                              when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,
                                          28 when he established the clouds above
                                              and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,
                                          29 when he gave the sea its boundary
                                              so the waters would not overstep his command,
                                          and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
                                          30     Then I was constantly[e] at his side.
                                          I was filled with delight day after day,
                                              rejoicing always in his presence,
                                          31 rejoicing in his whole world
                                              and delighting in mankind.

                                          32 “Now then, my children, listen to me;
                                              blessed are those who keep my ways.
                                          33 Listen to my instruction and be wise;
                                              do not disregard it.
                                          34 Blessed are those who listen to me,
                                              watching daily at my doors,
                                              waiting at my doorway.
                                          35 For those who find me find life
                                              and receive favor from the Lord.
                                          36 But those who fail to find me harm themselves;
                                              all who hate me love death.”

                                                 Invitations of Wisdom and Folly
                        9 Wisdom has built her house;
                            she has set up[a] its seven pillars.
                        2 She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine;
                            she has also set her table.
                        3 She has sent out her servants, and she calls
                            from the highest point of the city,
                        4     “Let all who are simple come to my house!”
                        To those who have no sense she says,
                        5     “Come, eat my food
                            and drink the wine I have mixed.
                        6 Leave your simple ways and you will live;
                            walk in the way of insight.”

                        7 Whoever corrects a mocker invites insults;
                            whoever rebukes the wicked incurs abuse.
                        8 Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you;
                            rebuke the wise and they will love you.
                        9 Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still;
                            teach the righteous and they will add to their learning.

                        10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
                            and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
                        11 For through wisdom[b] your days will be many,
                            and years will be added to your life.
                        12 If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you;
                            if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer.

                        13 Folly is an unruly woman;
                            she is simple and knows nothing.
                        14 She sits at the door of her house,
                            on a seat at the highest point of the city,
                        15 calling out to those who pass by,
                            who go straight on their way,
                        16     “Let all who are simple come to my house!”
                        To those who have no sense she says,
                        17     “Stolen water is sweet;
                            food eaten in secret is delicious!”
                        18 But little do they know that the dead are there,
                            that her guests are deep in the realm of the dead.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs X &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                              The proverbs of Solomon:

                                              A wise son brings joy to his father,
                                                  but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.

                                              2 Ill-gotten treasures have no lasting value,
                                                  but righteousness delivers from death.

                                              3 The Lord does not let the righteous go hungry,
                                                  but he thwarts the craving of the wicked.

                                              4 Lazy hands make for poverty,
                                                  but diligent hands bring wealth.

                                              5 He who gathers crops in summer is a prudent son,
                                                  but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son.

                                              6 Blessings crown the head of the righteous,
                                                  but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked.[a]

                                              7 The name of the righteous is used in blessings,[b]
                                                  but the name of the wicked will rot.

                                              8 The wise in heart accept commands,
                                                  but a chattering fool comes to ruin.

                                              9 Whoever walks in integrity walks securely,
                                                  but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.

                                              10 Whoever winks maliciously causes grief,
                                                  and a chattering fool comes to ruin.

                                              11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,
                                                  but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.

                                              12 Hatred stirs up conflict,
                                                  but love covers over all wrongs.

                                              13 Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning,
                                                  but a rod is for the back of one who has no sense.

                                              14 The wise store up knowledge,
                                                  but the mouth of a fool invites ruin.

                                              15 The wealth of the rich is their fortified city,
                                                  but poverty is the ruin of the poor.

                                              16 The wages of the righteous is life,
                                                  but the earnings of the wicked are sin and death.

                                              17 Whoever heeds discipline shows the way to life,
                                                  but whoever ignores correction leads others astray.

                                              18 Whoever conceals hatred with lying lips
                                                  and spreads slander is a fool.

                                              19 Sin is not ended by multiplying words,
                                                  but the prudent hold their tongues.

                                              20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver,
                                                  but the heart of the wicked is of little value.

                                              21 The lips of the righteous nourish many,
                                                  but fools die for lack of sense.

                                              22 The blessing of the Lord brings wealth,
                                                  without painful toil for it.

                                              23 A fool finds pleasure in wicked schemes,
                                                  but a person of understanding delights in wisdom.

                                              24 What the wicked dread will overtake them;
                                                  what the righteous desire will be granted.

                                              25 When the storm has swept by, the wicked are gone,
                                                  but the righteous stand firm forever.

                                              26 As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,
                                                  so are sluggards to those who send them.

                                              27 The fear of the Lord adds length to life,
                                                  but the years of the wicked are cut short.

                                              28 The prospect of the righteous is joy,
                                                  but the hopes of the wicked come to nothing.

                                              29 The way of the Lord is a refuge for the blameless,
                                                  but it is the ruin of those who do evil.

                                              30 The righteous will never be uprooted,
                                                  but the wicked will not remain in the land.

                                              31 From the mouth of the righteous comes the fruit of wisdom,
                                                  but a perverse tongue will be silenced.

                                              32 The lips of the righteous know what finds favor,
                                                  but the mouth of the wicked only what is perverse.
                                                    
                                                    </p>

            <p>
                                                                        The Lord detests dishonest scales,
                                                  but accurate weights find favor with him.

                                              2 When pride comes, then comes disgrace,
                                                  but with humility comes wisdom.

                                              3 The integrity of the upright guides them,
                                                  but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity.

                                              4 Wealth is worthless in the day of wrath,
                                                  but righteousness delivers from death.

                                              5 The righteousness of the blameless makes their paths straight,
                                                  but the wicked are brought down by their own wickedness.

                                              6 The righteousness of the upright delivers them,
                                                  but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires.

                                              7 Hopes placed in mortals die with them;
                                                  all the promise of[a] their power comes to nothing.

                                              8 The righteous person is rescued from trouble,
                                                  and it falls on the wicked instead.

                                              9 With their mouths the godless destroy their neighbors,
                                                  but through knowledge the righteous escape.

                                              10 When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices;
                                                  when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.

                                              11 Through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted,
                                                  but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed.

                                              12 Whoever derides their neighbor has no sense,
                                                  but the one who has understanding holds their tongue.

                                              13 A gossip betrays a confidence,
                                                  but a trustworthy person keeps a secret.

                                              14 For lack of guidance a nation falls,
                                                  but victory is won through many advisers.

                                              15 Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer,
                                                  but whoever refuses to shake hands in pledge is safe.

                                              16 A kindhearted woman gains honor,
                                                  but ruthless men gain only wealth.

                                              17 Those who are kind benefit themselves,
                                                  but the cruel bring ruin on themselves.

                                              18 A wicked person earns deceptive wages,
                                                  but the one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward.

                                              19 Truly the righteous attain life,
                                                  but whoever pursues evil finds death.

                                              20 The Lord detests those whose hearts are perverse,
                                                  but he delights in those whose ways are blameless.

                                              21 Be sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished,
                                                  but those who are righteous will go free.

                                              22 Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout
                                                  is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion.

                                              23 The desire of the righteous ends only in good,
                                                  but the hope of the wicked only in wrath.

                                              24 One person gives freely, yet gains even more;
                                                  another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty.

                                              25 A generous person will prosper;
                                                  whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.

                                              26 People curse the one who hoards grain,
                                                  but they pray God’s blessing on the one who is willing to sell.

                                              27 Whoever seeks good finds favor,
                                                  but evil comes to one who searches for it.

                                              28 Those who trust in their riches will fall,
                                                  but the righteous will thrive like a green leaf.

                                              29 Whoever brings ruin on their family will inherit only wind,
                                                  and the fool will be servant to the wise.

                                              30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,
                                                  and the one who is wise saves lives.

                                              31 If the righteous receive their due on earth,
                                                  how much more the ungodly and the sinner!

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XII &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                                  Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,
                                                      but whoever hates correction is stupid.

                                                  2 Good people obtain favor from the Lord,
                                                      but he condemns those who devise wicked schemes.

                                                  3 No one can be established through wickedness,
                                                      but the righteous cannot be uprooted.

                                                  4 A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown,
                                                      but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.

                                                  5 The plans of the righteous are just,
                                                      but the advice of the wicked is deceitful.

                                                  6 The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood,
                                                      but the speech of the upright rescues them.

                                                  7 The wicked are overthrown and are no more,
                                                      but the house of the righteous stands firm.

                                                  8 A person is praised according to their prudence,
                                                      and one with a warped mind is despised.

                                                  9 Better to be a nobody and yet have a servant
                                                      than pretend to be somebody and have no food.

                                                  10 The righteous care for the needs of their animals,
                                                      but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel.

                                                  11 Those who work their land will have abundant food,
                                                      but those who chase fantasies have no sense.

                                                  12 The wicked desire the stronghold of evildoers,
                                                      but the root of the righteous endures.

                                                  13 Evildoers are trapped by their sinful talk,
                                                      and so the innocent escape trouble.

                                                  14 From the fruit of their lips people are filled with good things,
                                                      and the work of their hands brings them reward.

                                                  15 The way of fools seems right to them,
                                                      but the wise listen to advice.

                                                  16 Fools show their annoyance at once,
                                                      but the prudent overlook an insult.

                                                  17 An honest witness tells the truth,
                                                      but a false witness tells lies.

                                                  18 The words of the reckless pierce like swords,
                                                      but the tongue of the wise brings healing.

                                                  19 Truthful lips endure forever,
                                                      but a lying tongue lasts only a moment.

                                                  20 Deceit is in the hearts of those who plot evil,
                                                      but those who promote peace have joy.

                                                  21 No harm overtakes the righteous,
                                                      but the wicked have their fill of trouble.

                                                  22 The Lord detests lying lips,
                                                      but he delights in people who are trustworthy.

                                                  23 The prudent keep their knowledge to themselves,
                                                      but a fool’s heart blurts out folly.

                                                  24 Diligent hands will rule,
                                                      but laziness ends in forced labor.

                                                  25 Anxiety weighs down the heart,
                                                      but a kind word cheers it up.

                                                  26 The righteous choose their friends carefully,
                                                      but the way of the wicked leads them astray.

                                                  27 The lazy do not roast[a] any game,
                                                      but the diligent feed on the riches of the hunt.

                                                  28 In the way of righteousness there is life;
                                                      along that path is immortality.

            <p>
                                              A wise son heeds his father’s instruction,
                                                  but a mocker does not respond to rebukes.

                                              2 From the fruit of their lips people enjoy good things,
                                                  but the unfaithful have an appetite for violence.

                                              3 Those who guard their lips preserve their lives,
                                                  but those who speak rashly will come to ruin.

                                              4 A sluggard’s appetite is never filled,
                                                  but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied.

                                              5 The righteous hate what is false,
                                                  but the wicked make themselves a stench
                                                  and bring shame on themselves.

                                              6 Righteousness guards the person of integrity,
                                                  but wickedness overthrows the sinner.

                                              7 One person pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;
                                                  another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth.

                                              8 A person’s riches may ransom their life,
                                                  but the poor cannot respond to threatening rebukes.

                                              9 The light of the righteous shines brightly,
                                                  but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out.

                                              10 Where there is strife, there is pride,
                                                  but wisdom is found in those who take advice.

                                              11 Dishonest money dwindles away,
                                                  but whoever gathers money little by little makes it grow.

                                              12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
                                                  but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.

                                              13 Whoever scorns instruction will pay for it,
                                                  but whoever respects a command is rewarded.

                                              14 The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life,
                                                  turning a person from the snares of death.

                                              15 Good judgment wins favor,
                                                  but the way of the unfaithful leads to their destruction.[a]

                                              16 All who are prudent act with[b] knowledge,
                                                  but fools expose their folly.

                                              17 A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
                                                  but a trustworthy envoy brings healing.

                                              18 Whoever disregards discipline comes to poverty and shame,
                                                  but whoever heeds correction is honored.

                                              19 A longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul,
                                                  but fools detest turning from evil.

                                              20 Walk with the wise and become wise,
                                                  for a companion of fools suffers harm.

                                              21 Trouble pursues the sinner,
                                                  but the righteous are rewarded with good things.

                                              22 A good person leaves an inheritance for their children’s children,
                                                  but a sinner’s wealth is stored up for the righteous.

                                              23 An unplowed field produces food for the poor,
                                                  but injustice sweeps it away.

                                              24 Whoever spares the rod hates their children,
                                                  but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them.

                                              25 The righteous eat to their hearts’ content,
                                                  but the stomach of the wicked goes hungry.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XIV &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                                        The wise woman builds her house,
                                                            but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down.

                                                        2 Whoever fears the Lord walks uprightly,
                                                            but those who despise him are devious in their ways.

                                                        3 A fool’s mouth lashes out with pride,
                                                            but the lips of the wise protect them.

                                                        4 Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty,
                                                            but from the strength of an ox come abundant harvests.

                                                        5 An honest witness does not deceive,
                                                            but a false witness pours out lies.

                                                        6 The mocker seeks wisdom and finds none,
                                                            but knowledge comes easily to the discerning.

                                                        7 Stay away from a fool,
                                                            for you will not find knowledge on their lips.

                                                        8 The wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to their ways,
                                                            but the folly of fools is deception.

                                                        9 Fools mock at making amends for sin,
                                                            but goodwill is found among the upright.

                                                        10 Each heart knows its own bitterness,
                                                            and no one else can share its joy.

                                                        11 The house of the wicked will be destroyed,
                                                            but the tent of the upright will flourish.

                                                        12 There is a way that appears to be right,
                                                            but in the end it leads to death.

                                                        13 Even in laughter the heart may ache,
                                                            and rejoicing may end in grief.

                                                        14 The faithless will be fully repaid for their ways,
                                                            and the good rewarded for theirs.

                                                        15 The simple believe anything,
                                                            but the prudent give thought to their steps.

                                                        16 The wise fear the Lord and shun evil,
                                                            but a fool is hotheaded and yet feels secure.

                                                        17 A quick-tempered person does foolish things,
                                                            and the one who devises evil schemes is hated.

                                                        18 The simple inherit folly,
                                                            but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

                                                        19 Evildoers will bow down in the presence of the good,
                                                            and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

                                                        20 The poor are shunned even by their neighbors,
                                                            but the rich have many friends.

                                                        21 It is a sin to despise one’s neighbor,
                                                            but blessed is the one who is kind to the needy.

                                                        22 Do not those who plot evil go astray?
                                                            But those who plan what is good find[a] love and faithfulness.

                                                        23 All hard work brings a profit,
                                                            but mere talk leads only to poverty.

                                                        24 The wealth of the wise is their crown,
                                                            but the folly of fools yields folly.

                                                        25 A truthful witness saves lives,
                                                            but a false witness is deceitful.

                                                        26 Whoever fears the Lord has a secure fortress,
                                                            and for their children it will be a refuge.

                                                        27 The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life,
                                                            turning a person from the snares of death.

                                                        28 A large population is a king’s glory,
                                                            but without subjects a prince is ruined.

                                                        29 Whoever is patient has great understanding,
                                                            but one who is quick-tempered displays folly.

                                                        30 A heart at peace gives life to the body,
                                                            but envy rots the bones.

                                                        31 Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker,
                                                            but whoever is kind to the needy honors God.

                                                        32 When calamity comes, the wicked are brought down,
                                                            but even in death the righteous seek refuge in God.

                                                        33 Wisdom reposes in the heart of the discerning
                                                            and even among fools she lets herself be known.[b]

                                                        34 Righteousness exalts a nation,
                                                            but sin condemns any people.

                                                        35 A king delights in a wise servant,
                                                            but a shameful servant arouses his fury.

            <p>
                                                A gentle answer turns away wrath,
                                                    but a harsh word stirs up anger.

                                                2 The tongue of the wise adorns knowledge,
                                                    but the mouth of the fool gushes folly.

                                                3 The eyes of the Lord are everywhere,
                                                    keeping watch on the wicked and the good.

                                                4 The soothing tongue is a tree of life,
                                                    but a perverse tongue crushes the spirit.

                                                5 A fool spurns a parent’s discipline,
                                                    but whoever heeds correction shows prudence.

                                                6 The house of the righteous contains great treasure,
                                                    but the income of the wicked brings ruin.

                                                7 The lips of the wise spread knowledge,
                                                    but the hearts of fools are not upright.

                                                8 The Lord detests the sacrifice of the wicked,
                                                    but the prayer of the upright pleases him.

                                                9 The Lord detests the way of the wicked,
                                                    but he loves those who pursue righteousness.

                                                10 Stern discipline awaits anyone who leaves the path;
                                                    the one who hates correction will die.

                                                11 Death and Destruction[a] lie open before the Lord—
                                                    how much more do human hearts!

                                                12 Mockers resent correction,
                                                    so they avoid the wise.

                                                13 A happy heart makes the face cheerful,
                                                    but heartache crushes the spirit.

                                                14 The discerning heart seeks knowledge,
                                                    but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly.

                                                15 All the days of the oppressed are wretched,
                                                    but the cheerful heart has a continual feast.

                                                16 Better a little with the fear of the Lord
                                                    than great wealth with turmoil.

                                                17 Better a small serving of vegetables with love
                                                    than a fattened calf with hatred.

                                                18 A hot-tempered person stirs up conflict,
                                                    but the one who is patient calms a quarrel.

                                                19 The way of the sluggard is blocked with thorns,
                                                    but the path of the upright is a highway.

                                                20 A wise son brings joy to his father,
                                                    but a foolish man despises his mother.

                                                21 Folly brings joy to one who has no sense,
                                                    but whoever has understanding keeps a straight course.

                                                22 Plans fail for lack of counsel,
                                                    but with many advisers they succeed.

                                                23 A person finds joy in giving an apt reply—
                                                    and how good is a timely word!

                                                24 The path of life leads upward for the prudent
                                                    to keep them from going down to the realm of the dead.

                                                25 The Lord tears down the house of the proud,
                                                    but he sets the widow’s boundary stones in place.

                                                26 The Lord detests the thoughts of the wicked,
                                                    but gracious words are pure in his sight.

                                                27 The greedy bring ruin to their households,
                                                    but the one who hates bribes will live.

                                                28 The heart of the righteous weighs its answers,
                                                    but the mouth of the wicked gushes evil.

                                                29 The Lord is far from the wicked,
                                                    but he hears the prayer of the righteous.

                                                30 Light in a messenger’s eyes brings joy to the heart,
                                                    and good news gives health to the bones.

                                                31 Whoever heeds life-giving correction
                                                    will be at home among the wise.

                                                32 Those who disregard discipline despise themselves,
                                                    but the one who heeds correction gains understanding.

                                                33 Wisdom’s instruction is to fear the Lord,
                                                    and humility comes before honor.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XVI &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                                      To humans belong the plans of the heart,
                                                          but from the Lord comes the proper answer of the tongue.

                                                      2 All a person’s ways seem pure to them,
                                                          but motives are weighed by the Lord.

                                                      3 Commit to the Lord whatever you do,
                                                          and he will establish your plans.

                                                      4 The Lord works out everything to its proper end—
                                                          even the wicked for a day of disaster.

                                                      5 The Lord detests all the proud of heart.
                                                          Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished.

                                                      6 Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for;
                                                          through the fear of the Lord evil is avoided.

                                                      7 When the Lord takes pleasure in anyone’s way,
                                                          he causes their enemies to make peace with them.

                                                      8 Better a little with righteousness
                                                          than much gain with injustice.

                                                      9 In their hearts humans plan their course,
                                                          but the Lord establishes their steps.

                                                      10 The lips of a king speak as an oracle,
                                                          and his mouth does not betray justice.

                                                      11 Honest scales and balances belong to the Lord;
                                                          all the weights in the bag are of his making.

                                                      12 Kings detest wrongdoing,
                                                          for a throne is established through righteousness.

                                                      13 Kings take pleasure in honest lips;
                                                          they value the one who speaks what is right.

                                                      14 A king’s wrath is a messenger of death,
                                                          but the wise will appease it.

                                                      15 When a king’s face brightens, it means life;
                                                          his favor is like a rain cloud in spring.

                                                      16 How much better to get wisdom than gold,
                                                          to get insight rather than silver!

                                                      17 The highway of the upright avoids evil;
                                                          those who guard their ways preserve their lives.

                                                      18 Pride goes before destruction,
                                                          a haughty spirit before a fall.

                                                      19 Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed
                                                          than to share plunder with the proud.

                                                      20 Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers,[a]
                                                          and blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord.

                                                      21 The wise in heart are called discerning,
                                                          and gracious words promote instruction.[b]

                                                      22 Prudence is a fountain of life to the prudent,
                                                          but folly brings punishment to fools.

                                                      23 The hearts of the wise make their mouths prudent,
                                                          and their lips promote instruction.[c]

                                                      24 Gracious words are a honeycomb,
                                                          sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.

                                                      25 There is a way that appears to be right,
                                                          but in the end it leads to death.

                                                      26 The appetite of laborers works for them;
                                                          their hunger drives them on.

                                                      27 A scoundrel plots evil,
                                                          and on their lips it is like a scorching fire.

                                                      28 A perverse person stirs up conflict,
                                                          and a gossip separates close friends.

                                                      29 A violent person entices their neighbor
                                                          and leads them down a path that is not good.

                                                      30 Whoever winks with their eye is plotting perversity;
                                                          whoever purses their lips is bent on evil.

                                                      31 Gray hair is a crown of splendor;
                                                          it is attained in the way of righteousness.

                                                      32 Better a patient person than a warrior,
                                                          one with self-control than one who takes a city.

                                                      33 The lot is cast into the lap,
                                                          but its every decision is from the Lord.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XVII &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                              Better a dry crust with peace and quiet
                                                  than a house full of feasting, with strife.

                                              2 A prudent servant will rule over a disgraceful son
                                                  and will share the inheritance as one of the family.

                                              3 The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold,
                                                  but the Lord tests the heart.

                                              4 A wicked person listens to deceitful lips;
                                                  a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.

                                              5 Whoever mocks the poor shows contempt for their Maker;
                                                  whoever gloats over disaster will not go unpunished.

                                              6 Children’s children are a crown to the aged,
                                                  and parents are the pride of their children.

                                              7 Eloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool—
                                                  how much worse lying lips to a ruler!

                                              8 A bribe is seen as a charm by the one who gives it;
                                                  they think success will come at every turn.

                                              9 Whoever would foster love covers over an offense,
                                                  but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends.

                                              10 A rebuke impresses a discerning person
                                                  more than a hundred lashes a fool.

                                              11 Evildoers foster rebellion against God;
                                                  the messenger of death will be sent against them.

                                              12 Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs
                                                  than a fool bent on folly.

                                              13 Evil will never leave the house
                                                  of one who pays back evil for good.

                                              14 Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam;
                                                  so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out.

                                              15 Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent—
                                                  the Lord detests them both.

                                              16 Why should fools have money in hand to buy wisdom,
                                                  when they are not able to understand it?

                                              17 A friend loves at all times,
                                                  and a brother is born for a time of adversity.

                                              18 One who has no sense shakes hands in pledge
                                                  and puts up security for a neighbor.

                                              19 Whoever loves a quarrel loves sin;
                                                  whoever builds a high gate invites destruction.

                                              20 One whose heart is corrupt does not prosper;
                                                  one whose tongue is perverse falls into trouble.

                                              21 To have a fool for a child brings grief;
                                                  there is no joy for the parent of a godless fool.

                                              22 A cheerful heart is good medicine,
                                                  but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.

                                              23 The wicked accept bribes in secret
                                                  to pervert the course of justice.

                                              24 A discerning person keeps wisdom in view,
                                                  but a fool’s eyes wander to the ends of the earth.

                                              25 A foolish son brings grief to his father
                                                  and bitterness to the mother who bore him.

                                              26 If imposing a fine on the innocent is not good,
                                                  surely to flog honest officials is not right.

                                              27 The one who has knowledge uses words with restraint,
                                                  and whoever has understanding is even-tempered.

                                              28 Even fools are thought wise if they keep silent,
                                                  and discerning if they hold their tongues.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XVIII &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                    An unfriendly person pursues selfish ends
                                        and against all sound judgment starts quarrels.

                                    2 Fools find no pleasure in understanding
                                        but delight in airing their own opinions.

                                    3 When wickedness comes, so does contempt,
                                        and with shame comes reproach.

                                    4 The words of the mouth are deep waters,
                                        but the fountain of wisdom is a rushing stream.

                                    5 It is not good to be partial to the wicked
                                        and so deprive the innocent of justice.

                                    6 The lips of fools bring them strife,
                                        and their mouths invite a beating.

                                    7 The mouths of fools are their undoing,
                                        and their lips are a snare to their very lives.

                                    8 The words of a gossip are like choice morsels;
                                        they go down to the inmost parts.

                                    9 One who is slack in his work
                                        is brother to one who destroys.

                                    10 The name of the Lord is a fortified tower;
                                        the righteous run to it and are safe.

                                    11 The wealth of the rich is their fortified city;
                                        they imagine it a wall too high to scale.

                                    12 Before a downfall the heart is haughty,
                                        but humility comes before honor.

                                    13 To answer before listening—
                                        that is folly and shame.

                                    14 The human spirit can endure in sickness,
                                        but a crushed spirit who can bear?

                                    15 The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge,
                                        for the ears of the wise seek it out.

                                    16 A gift opens the way
                                        and ushers the giver into the presence of the great.

                                    17 In a lawsuit the first to speak seems right,
                                        until someone comes forward and cross-examines.

                                    18 Casting the lot settles disputes
                                        and keeps strong opponents apart.

                                    19 A brother wronged is more unyielding than a fortified city;
                                        disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel.

                                    20 From the fruit of their mouth a person’s stomach is filled;
                                        with the harvest of their lips they are satisfied.

                                    21 The tongue has the power of life and death,
                                        and those who love it will eat its fruit.

                                    22 He who finds a wife finds what is good
                                        and receives favor from the Lord.

                                    23 The poor plead for mercy,
                                        but the rich answer harshly.

                                    24 One who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin,
                                        but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

            <p>
                            Better the poor whose walk is blameless
                                    than a fool whose lips are perverse.

                                2 Desire without knowledge is not good—
                                    how much more will hasty feet miss the way!

                                3 A person’s own folly leads to their ruin,
                                    yet their heart rages against the Lord.

                                4 Wealth attracts many friends,
                                    but even the closest friend of the poor person deserts them.

                                5 A false witness will not go unpunished,
                                    and whoever pours out lies will not go free.

                                6 Many curry favor with a ruler,
                                    and everyone is the friend of one who gives gifts.

                                7 The poor are shunned by all their relatives—
                                    how much more do their friends avoid them!
                                Though the poor pursue them with pleading,
                                    they are nowhere to be found.[a]

                                8 The one who gets wisdom loves life;
                                    the one who cherishes understanding will soon prosper.

                                9 A false witness will not go unpunished,
                                    and whoever pours out lies will perish.

                                10 It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury—
                                    how much worse for a slave to rule over princes!

                                11 A person’s wisdom yields patience;
                                    it is to one’s glory to overlook an offense.

                                12 A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion,
                                    but his favor is like dew on the grass.

                                13 A foolish child is a father’s ruin,
                                    and a quarrelsome wife is like
                                    the constant dripping of a leaky roof.

                                14 Houses and wealth are inherited from parents,
                                    but a prudent wife is from the Lord.

                                15 Laziness brings on deep sleep,
                                    and the shiftless go hungry.

                                16 Whoever keeps commandments keeps their life,
                                    but whoever shows contempt for their ways will die.

                                17 Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the Lord,
                                    and he will reward them for what they have done.

                                18 Discipline your children, for in that there is hope;
                                    do not be a willing party to their death.

                                19 A hot-tempered person must pay the penalty;
                                    rescue them, and you will have to do it again.

                                20 Listen to advice and accept discipline,
                                    and at the end you will be counted among the wise.

                                21 Many are the plans in a person’s heart,
                                    but it is the Lord’s purpose that prevails.

                                22 What a person desires is unfailing love[b];
                                    better to be poor than a liar.

                                23 The fear of the Lord leads to life;
                                    then one rests content, untouched by trouble.

                                24 A sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
                                    he will not even bring it back to his mouth!

                                25 Flog a mocker, and the simple will learn prudence;
                                    rebuke the discerning, and they will gain knowledge.

                                26 Whoever robs their father and drives out their mother
                                    is a child who brings shame and disgrace.

                                27 Stop listening to instruction, my son,
                                    and you will stray from the words of knowledge.

                                28 A corrupt witness mocks at justice,
                                    and the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil.

                                29 Penalties are prepared for mockers,
                                    and beatings for the backs of fools.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XX &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                                Wine is a mocker and beer a brawler;
                                                    whoever is led astray by them is not wise.

                                                2 A king’s wrath strikes terror like the roar of a lion;
                                                    those who anger him forfeit their lives.

                                                3 It is to one’s honor to avoid strife,
                                                    but every fool is quick to quarrel.

                                                4 Sluggards do not plow in season;
                                                    so at harvest time they look but find nothing.

                                                5 The purposes of a person’s heart are deep waters,
                                                    but one who has insight draws them out.

                                                6 Many claim to have unfailing love,
                                                    but a faithful person who can find?

                                                7 The righteous lead blameless lives;
                                                    blessed are their children after them.

                                                8 When a king sits on his throne to judge,
                                                    he winnows out all evil with his eyes.

                                                9 Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure;
                                                    I am clean and without sin”?

                                                10 Differing weights and differing measures—
                                                    the Lord detests them both.

                                                11 Even small children are known by their actions,
                                                    so is their conduct really pure and upright?

                                                12 Ears that hear and eyes that see—
                                                    the Lord has made them both.

                                                13 Do not love sleep or you will grow poor;
                                                    stay awake and you will have food to spare.

                                                14 “It’s no good, it’s no good!” says the buyer—
                                                    then goes off and boasts about the purchase.

                                                15 Gold there is, and rubies in abundance,
                                                    but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel.

                                                16 Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger;
                                                    hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider.

                                                17 Food gained by fraud tastes sweet,
                                                    but one ends up with a mouth full of gravel.

                                                18 Plans are established by seeking advice;
                                                    so if you wage war, obtain guidance.

                                                19 A gossip betrays a confidence;
                                                    so avoid anyone who talks too much.

                                                20 If someone curses their father or mother,
                                                    their lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness.

                                                21 An inheritance claimed too soon
                                                    will not be blessed at the end.

                                                22 Do not say, “I’ll pay you back for this wrong!”
                                                    Wait for the Lord, and he will avenge you.

                                                23 The Lord detests differing weights,
                                                    and dishonest scales do not please him.

                                                24 A person’s steps are directed by the Lord.
                                                    How then can anyone understand their own way?

                                                25 It is a trap to dedicate something rashly
                                                    and only later to consider one’s vows.

                                                26 A wise king winnows out the wicked;
                                                    he drives the threshing wheel over them.

                                                27 The human spirit is[a] the lamp of the Lord
                                                    that sheds light on one’s inmost being.

                                                28 Love and faithfulness keep a king safe;
                                                    through love his throne is made secure.

                                                29 The glory of young men is their strength,
                                                    gray hair the splendor of the old.

                                                30 Blows and wounds scrub away evil,
                                                    and beatings purge the inmost being.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XXI &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                              In the Lord’s hand the king’s heart is a stream of water
                                                  that he channels toward all who please him.

                                              2 A person may think their own ways are right,
                                                  but the Lord weighs the heart.

                                              3 To do what is right and just
                                                  is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.

                                              4 Haughty eyes and a proud heart—
                                                  the unplowed field of the wicked—produce sin.

                                              5 The plans of the diligent lead to profit
                                                  as surely as haste leads to poverty.

                                              6 A fortune made by a lying tongue
                                                  is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare.[a]

                                              7 The violence of the wicked will drag them away,
                                                  for they refuse to do what is right.

                                              8 The way of the guilty is devious,
                                                  but the conduct of the innocent is upright.

                                              9 Better to live on a corner of the roof
                                                  than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.

                                              10 The wicked crave evil;
                                                  their neighbors get no mercy from them.

                                              11 When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom;
                                                  by paying attention to the wise they get knowledge.

                                              12 The Righteous One[b] takes note of the house of the wicked
                                                  and brings the wicked to ruin.

                                              13 Whoever shuts their ears to the cry of the poor
                                                  will also cry out and not be answered.

                                              14 A gift given in secret soothes anger,
                                                  and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath.

                                              15 When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous
                                                  but terror to evildoers.

                                              16 Whoever strays from the path of prudence
                                                  comes to rest in the company of the dead.

                                              17 Whoever loves pleasure will become poor;
                                                  whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.

                                              18 The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,
                                                  and the unfaithful for the upright.

                                              19 Better to live in a desert
                                                  than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife.

                                              20 The wise store up choice food and olive oil,
                                                  but fools gulp theirs down.

                                              21 Whoever pursues righteousness and love
                                                  finds life, prosperity[c] and honor.

                                              22 One who is wise can go up against the city of the mighty
                                                  and pull down the stronghold in which they trust.

                                              23 Those who guard their mouths and their tongues
                                                  keep themselves from calamity.

                                              24 The proud and arrogant person—“Mocker” is his name—
                                                  behaves with insolent fury.

                                              25 The craving of a sluggard will be the death of him,
                                                  because his hands refuse to work.
                                              26 All day long he craves for more,
                                                  but the righteous give without sparing.

                                              27 The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable—
                                                  how much more so when brought with evil intent!

                                              28 A false witness will perish,
                                                  but a careful listener will testify successfully.

                                              29 The wicked put up a bold front,
                                                  but the upright give thought to their ways.

                                              30 There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
                                                  that can succeed against the Lord.

                                              31 The horse is made ready for the day of battle,
                                                  but victory rests with the Lord.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XXII &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                                  A good name is more desirable than great riches;
                                                      to be esteemed is better than silver or gold.

                                                  2 Rich and poor have this in common:
                                                      The Lord is the Maker of them all.

                                                  3 The prudent see danger and take refuge,
                                                      but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.

                                                  4 Humility is the fear of the Lord;
                                                      its wages are riches and honor and life.

                                                  5 In the paths of the wicked are snares and pitfalls,
                                                      but those who would preserve their life stay far from them.

                                                  6 Start children off on the way they should go,
                                                      and even when they are old they will not turn from it.

                                                  7 The rich rule over the poor,
                                                      and the borrower is slave to the lender.

                                                  8 Whoever sows injustice reaps calamity,
                                                      and the rod they wield in fury will be broken.

                                                  9 The generous will themselves be blessed,
                                                      for they share their food with the poor.

                                                  10 Drive out the mocker, and out goes strife;
                                                      quarrels and insults are ended.

                                                  11 One who loves a pure heart and who speaks with grace
                                                      will have the king for a friend.

                                                  12 The eyes of the Lord keep watch over knowledge,
                                                      but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.

                                                  13 The sluggard says, “There’s a lion outside!
                                                      I’ll be killed in the public square!”

                                                  14 The mouth of an adulterous woman is a deep pit;
                                                      a man who is under the Lord’s wrath falls into it.

                                                  15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,
                                                      but the rod of discipline will drive it far away.

                                                  16 One who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth
                                                      and one who gives gifts to the rich—both come to poverty.

                                                  Thirty Sayings of the Wise
                                                  Saying 1
                                                  17 Pay attention and turn your ear to the sayings of the wise;
                                                      apply your heart to what I teach,
                                                  18 for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart
                                                      and have all of them ready on your lips.
                                                  19 So that your trust may be in the Lord,
                                                      I teach you today, even you.
                                                  20 Have I not written thirty sayings for you,
                                                      sayings of counsel and knowledge,
                                                  21 teaching you to be honest and to speak the truth,
                                                      so that you bring back truthful reports
                                                      to those you serve?

                                                  Saying 2
                                                  22 Do not exploit the poor because they are poor
                                                      and do not crush the needy in court,
                                                  23 for the Lord will take up their case
                                                      and will exact life for life.

                                                  Saying 3
                                                  24 Do not make friends with a hot-tempered person,
                                                      do not associate with one easily angered,
                                                  25 or you may learn their ways
                                                      and get yourself ensnared.

                                                  Saying 4
                                                  26 Do not be one who shakes hands in pledge
                                                      or puts up security for debts;
                                                  27 if you lack the means to pay,
                                                      your very bed will be snatched from under you.

                                                  Saying 5
                                                  28 Do not move an ancient boundary stone
                                                      set up by your ancestors.

                                                  Saying 6
                                                  29 Do you see someone skilled in their work?
                                                      They will serve before kings;
                                                      they will not serve before officials of low rank.

            <p>
                                    When you sit to dine with a ruler,
                                        note well what[a] is before you,
                                    2 and put a knife to your throat
                                        if you are given to gluttony.
                                    3 Do not crave his delicacies,
                                        for that food is deceptive.

                                    Saying 8
                                    4 Do not wear yourself out to get rich;
                                        do not trust your own cleverness.
                                    5 Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone,
                                        for they will surely sprout wings
                                        and fly off to the sky like an eagle.

                                    Saying 9
                                    6 Do not eat the food of a begrudging host,
                                        do not crave his delicacies;
                                    7 for he is the kind of person
                                        who is always thinking about the cost.[b]
                                    “Eat and drink,” he says to you,
                                        but his heart is not with you.
                                    8 You will vomit up the little you have eaten
                                        and will have wasted your compliments.

                                    Saying 10
                                    9 Do not speak to fools,
                                        for they will scorn your prudent words.

                                    Saying 11
                                    10 Do not move an ancient boundary stone
                                        or encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
                                    11 for their Defender is strong;
                                        he will take up their case against you.

                                    Saying 12
                                    12 Apply your heart to instruction
                                        and your ears to words of knowledge.

                                    Saying 13
                                    13 Do not withhold discipline from a child;
                                        if you punish them with the rod, they will not die.
                                    14 Punish them with the rod
                                        and save them from death.

                                    Saying 14
                                    15 My son, if your heart is wise,
                                        then my heart will be glad indeed;
                                    16 my inmost being will rejoice
                                        when your lips speak what is right.

                                    Saying 15
                                    17 Do not let your heart envy sinners,
                                        but always be zealous for the fear of the Lord.
                                    18 There is surely a future hope for you,
                                        and your hope will not be cut off.

                                    Saying 16
                                    19 Listen, my son, and be wise,
                                        and set your heart on the right path:
                                    20 Do not join those who drink too much wine
                                        or gorge themselves on meat,
                                    21 for drunkards and gluttons become poor,
                                        and drowsiness clothes them in rags.

                                    Saying 17
                                    22 Listen to your father, who gave you life,
                                        and do not despise your mother when she is old.
                                    23 Buy the truth and do not sell it—
                                        wisdom, instruction and insight as well.
                                    24 The father of a righteous child has great joy;
                                        a man who fathers a wise son rejoices in him.
                                    25 May your father and mother rejoice;
                                        may she who gave you birth be joyful!

                                    Saying 18
                                    26 My son, give me your heart
                                        and let your eyes delight in my ways,
                                    27 for an adulterous woman is a deep pit,
                                        and a wayward wife is a narrow well.
                                    28 Like a bandit she lies in wait
                                        and multiplies the unfaithful among men.

                                    Saying 19
                                    29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
                                        Who has strife? Who has complaints?
                                        Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?
                                    30 Those who linger over wine,
                                        who go to sample bowls of mixed wine.
                                    31 Do not gaze at wine when it is red,
                                        when it sparkles in the cup,
                                        when it goes down smoothly!
                                    32 In the end it bites like a snake
                                        and poisons like a viper.
                                    33 Your eyes will see strange sights,
                                        and your mind will imagine confusing things.
                                    34 You will be like one sleeping on the high seas,
                                        lying on top of the rigging.
                                    35 “They hit me,” you will say, “but I’m not hurt!
                                        They beat me, but I don’t feel it!
                                    When will I wake up
                                        so I can find another drink?”

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XXIV &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                              Do not envy the wicked,
                                                  do not desire their company;
                                              2 for their hearts plot violence,
                                                  and their lips talk about making trouble.

                                              Saying 21
                                              3 By wisdom a house is built,
                                                  and through understanding it is established;
                                              4 through knowledge its rooms are filled
                                                  with rare and beautiful treasures.

                                              Saying 22
                                              5 The wise prevail through great power,
                                                  and those who have knowledge muster their strength.
                                              6 Surely you need guidance to wage war,
                                                  and victory is won through many advisers.

                                              Saying 23
                                              7 Wisdom is too high for fools;
                                                  in the assembly at the gate they must not open their mouths.

                                              Saying 24
                                              8 Whoever plots evil
                                                  will be known as a schemer.
                                              9 The schemes of folly are sin,
                                                  and people detest a mocker.

                                              Saying 25
                                              10 If you falter in a time of trouble,
                                                  how small is your strength!
                                              11 Rescue those being led away to death;
                                                  hold back those staggering toward slaughter.
                                              12 If you say, “But we knew nothing about this,”
                                                  does not he who weighs the heart perceive it?
                                              Does not he who guards your life know it?
                                                  Will he not repay everyone according to what they have done?

                                              Saying 26
                                              13 Eat honey, my son, for it is good;
                                                  honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.
                                              14 Know also that wisdom is like honey for you:
                                                  If you find it, there is a future hope for you,
                                                  and your hope will not be cut off.

                                              Saying 27
                                              15 Do not lurk like a thief near the house of the righteous,
                                                  do not plunder their dwelling place;
                                              16 for though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again,
                                                  but the wicked stumble when calamity strikes.

                                              Saying 28
                                              17 Do not gloat when your enemy falls;
                                                  when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice,
                                              18 or the Lord will see and disapprove
                                                  and turn his wrath away from them.

                                              Saying 29
                                              19 Do not fret because of evildoers
                                                  or be envious of the wicked,
                                              20 for the evildoer has no future hope,
                                                  and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.

                                              Saying 30
                                              21 Fear the Lord and the king, my son,
                                                  and do not join with rebellious officials,
                                              22 for those two will send sudden destruction on them,
                                                  and who knows what calamities they can bring?

                                              Further Sayings of the Wise
                                              23 These also are sayings of the wise:

                                              To show partiality in judging is not good:
                                              24 Whoever says to the guilty, “You are innocent,”
                                                  will be cursed by peoples and denounced by nations.
                                              25 But it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
                                                  and rich blessing will come on them.

                                              26 An honest answer
                                                  is like a kiss on the lips.

                                              27 Put your outdoor work in order
                                                  and get your fields ready;
                                                  after that, build your house.

                                              28 Do not testify against your neighbor without cause—
                                                  would you use your lips to mislead?
                                              29 Do not say, “I’ll do to them as they have done to me;
                                                  I’ll pay them back for what they did.”

                                              30 I went past the field of a sluggard,
                                                  past the vineyard of someone who has no sense;
                                              31 thorns had come up everywhere,
                                                  the ground was covered with weeds,
                                                  and the stone wall was in ruins.
                                              32 I applied my heart to what I observed
                                                  and learned a lesson from what I saw:
                                              33 A little sleep, a little slumber,
                                                  a little folding of the hands to rest—
                                              34 and poverty will come on you like a thief
                                                  and scarcity like an armed man.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XXV &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                                      These are more proverbs of Solomon, compiled by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:

                                                      2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;
                                                          to search out a matter is the glory of kings.
                                                      3 As the heavens are high and the earth is deep,
                                                          so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.

                                                      4 Remove the dross from the silver,
                                                          and a silversmith can produce a vessel;
                                                      5 remove wicked officials from the king’s presence,
                                                          and his throne will be established through righteousness.

                                                      6 Do not exalt yourself in the king’s presence,
                                                          and do not claim a place among his great men;
                                                      7 it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,”
                                                          than for him to humiliate you before his nobles.

                                                      What you have seen with your eyes
                                                      8     do not bring[a] hastily to court,
                                                      for what will you do in the end
                                                          if your neighbor puts you to shame?

                                                      9 If you take your neighbor to court,
                                                          do not betray another’s confidence,
                                                      10 or the one who hears it may shame you
                                                          and the charge against you will stand.

                                                      11 Like apples[b] of gold in settings of silver
                                                          is a ruling rightly given.
                                                      12 Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold
                                                          is the rebuke of a wise judge to a listening ear.

                                                      13 Like a snow-cooled drink at harvest time
                                                          is a trustworthy messenger to the one who sends him;
                                                          he refreshes the spirit of his master.
                                                      14 Like clouds and wind without rain
                                                          is one who boasts of gifts never given.

                                                      15 Through patience a ruler can be persuaded,
                                                          and a gentle tongue can break a bone.

                                                      16 If you find honey, eat just enough—
                                                          too much of it, and you will vomit.
                                                      17 Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house—
                                                          too much of you, and they will hate you.

                                                      18 Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow
                                                          is one who gives false testimony against a neighbor.
                                                      19 Like a broken tooth or a lame foot
                                                          is reliance on the unfaithful in a time of trouble.
                                                      20 Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day,
                                                          or like vinegar poured on a wound,
                                                          is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.

                                                      21 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat;
                                                          if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
                                                      22 In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head,
                                                          and the Lord will reward you.

                                                      23 Like a north wind that brings unexpected rain
                                                          is a sly tongue—which provokes a horrified look.

                                                      24 Better to live on a corner of the roof
                                                          than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.

                                                      25 Like cold water to a weary soul
                                                          is good news from a distant land.
                                                      26 Like a muddied spring or a polluted well
                                                          are the righteous who give way to the wicked.

                                                      27 It is not good to eat too much honey,
                                                          nor is it honorable to search out matters that are too deep.

                                                      28 Like a city whose walls are broken through
                                                          is a person who lacks self-control.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XXVI &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                              Like snow in summer or rain in harvest,
                                                  honor is not fitting for a fool.
                                              2 Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow,
                                                  an undeserved curse does not come to rest.
                                              3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
                                                  and a rod for the backs of fools!
                                              4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
                                                  or you yourself will be just like him.
                                              5 Answer a fool according to his folly,
                                                  or he will be wise in his own eyes.
                                              6 Sending a message by the hands of a fool
                                                  is like cutting off one’s feet or drinking poison.
                                              7 Like the useless legs of one who is lame
                                                  is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
                                              8 Like tying a stone in a sling
                                                  is the giving of honor to a fool.
                                              9 Like a thornbush in a drunkard’s hand
                                                  is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
                                              10 Like an archer who wounds at random
                                                  is one who hires a fool or any passer-by.
                                              11 As a dog returns to its vomit,
                                                  so fools repeat their folly.
                                              12 Do you see a person wise in their own eyes?
                                                  There is more hope for a fool than for them.

                                              13 A sluggard says, “There’s a lion in the road,
                                                  a fierce lion roaming the streets!”
                                              14 As a door turns on its hinges,
                                                  so a sluggard turns on his bed.
                                              15 A sluggard buries his hand in the dish;
                                                  he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
                                              16 A sluggard is wiser in his own eyes
                                                  than seven people who answer discreetly.

                                              17 Like one who grabs a stray dog by the ears
                                                  is someone who rushes into a quarrel not their own.

                                              18 Like a maniac shooting
                                                  flaming arrows of death
                                              19 is one who deceives their neighbor
                                                  and says, “I was only joking!”

                                              20 Without wood a fire goes out;
                                                  without a gossip a quarrel dies down.
                                              21 As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire,
                                                  so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.
                                              22 The words of a gossip are like choice morsels;
                                                  they go down to the inmost parts.

                                              23 Like a coating of silver dross on earthenware
                                                  are fervent[a] lips with an evil heart.
                                              24 Enemies disguise themselves with their lips,
                                                  but in their hearts they harbor deceit.
                                              25 Though their speech is charming, do not believe them,
                                                  for seven abominations fill their hearts.
                                              26 Their malice may be concealed by deception,
                                                  but their wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
                                              27 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it;
                                                  if someone rolls a stone, it will roll back on them.
                                              28 A lying tongue hates those it hurts,
                                                  and a flattering mouth works ruin.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XXVII &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                                Do not boast about tomorrow,
                                                    for you do not know what a day may bring.

                                                2 Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth;
                                                    an outsider, and not your own lips.

                                                3 Stone is heavy and sand a burden,
                                                    but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.

                                                4 Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming,
                                                    but who can stand before jealousy?

                                                5 Better is open rebuke
                                                    than hidden love.

                                                6 Wounds from a friend can be trusted,
                                                    but an enemy multiplies kisses.

                                                7 One who is full loathes honey from the comb,
                                                    but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet.

                                                8 Like a bird that flees its nest
                                                    is anyone who flees from home.

                                                9 Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart,
                                                    and the pleasantness of a friend
                                                    springs from their heartfelt advice.

                                                10 Do not forsake your friend or a friend of your family,
                                                    and do not go to your relative’s house when disaster strikes you—
                                                    better a neighbor nearby than a relative far away.

                                                11 Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart;
                                                    then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt.

                                                12 The prudent see danger and take refuge,
                                                    but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.

                                                13 Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger;
                                                    hold it in pledge if it is done for an outsider.

                                                14 If anyone loudly blesses their neighbor early in the morning,
                                                    it will be taken as a curse.

                                                15 A quarrelsome wife is like the dripping
                                                    of a leaky roof in a rainstorm;
                                                16 restraining her is like restraining the wind
                                                    or grasping oil with the hand.

                                                17 As iron sharpens iron,
                                                    so one person sharpens another.

                                                18 The one who guards a fig tree will eat its fruit,
                                                    and whoever protects their master will be honored.

                                                19 As water reflects the face,
                                                    so one’s life reflects the heart.[a]

                                                20 Death and Destruction[b] are never satisfied,
                                                    and neither are human eyes.

                                                21 The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold,
                                                    but people are tested by their praise.

                                                22 Though you grind a fool in a mortar,
                                                    grinding them like grain with a pestle,
                                                    you will not remove their folly from them.

                                                23 Be sure you know the condition of your flocks,
                                                    give careful attention to your herds;
                                                24 for riches do not endure forever,
                                                    and a crown is not secure for all generations.
                                                25 When the hay is removed and new growth appears
                                                    and the grass from the hills is gathered in,
                                                26 the lambs will provide you with clothing,
                                                    and the goats with the price of a field.
                                                27 You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed your family
                                                    and to nourish your female servants.

         <h2 className={styles.chapter}> Proverbs XXVIII &darr;</h2>
            <p>
                                                The wicked flee though no one pursues,
                                                    but the righteous are as bold as a lion.

                                                2 When a country is rebellious, it has many rulers,
                                                    but a ruler with discernment and knowledge maintains order.

                                                3 A ruler[a] who oppresses the poor
                                                    is like a driving rain that leaves no crops.

                                                4 Those who forsake instruction praise the wicked,
                                                    but those who heed it resist them.

                                                5 Evildoers do not understand what is right,
                                                    but those who seek the Lord understand it fully.

                                                6 Better the poor whose walk is blameless
                                                    than the rich whose ways are perverse.

                                                7 A discerning son heeds instruction,
                                                    but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.

                                                8 Whoever increases wealth by taking interest or profit from the poor
                                                    amasses it for another, who will be kind to the poor.

                                                9 If anyone turns a deaf ear to my instruction,
                                                    even their prayers are detestable.

                                                10 Whoever leads the upright along an evil path
                                                    will fall into their own trap,
                                                    but the blameless will receive a good inheritance.

                                                11 The rich are wise in their own eyes;
                                                    one who is poor and discerning sees how deluded they are.

                                                12 When the righteous triumph, there is great elation;
                                                    but when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding.

                                                13 Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper,
                                                    but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy.

                                                14 Blessed is the one who always trembles before God,
                                                    but whoever hardens their heart falls into trouble.

                                                15 Like a roaring lion or a charging bear
                                                    is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.

                                                16 A tyrannical ruler practices extortion,
                                                    but one who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a long reign.

                                                17 Anyone tormented by the guilt of murder
                                                    will seek refuge in the grave;
                                                    let no one hold them back.

                                                18 The one whose walk is blameless is kept safe,
                                                    but the one whose ways are perverse will fall into the pit.[b]

                                                19 Those who work their land will have abundant food,
                                                    but those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty.

                                                20 A faithful person will be richly blessed,
                                                    but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished.

                                                21 To show partiality is not good—
                                                    yet a person will do wrong for a piece of bread.

                                                22 The stingy are eager to get rich
                                                    and are unaware that poverty awaits them.

                                                23 Whoever rebukes a person will in the end gain favor
                                                    rather than one who has a flattering tongue.

                                                24 Whoever robs their father or mother
                                                    and says, “It’s not wrong,”
                                                    is partner to one who destroys.

                                                25 The greedy stir up conflict,
                                                    but those who trust in the Lord will prosper.

                                                26 Those who trust in themselves are fools,
                                                    but those who walk in wisdom are kept safe.

                                                27 Those who give to the poor will lack nothing,
                                                    but those who close their eyes to them receive many curses.

                                                28 When the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding;
                                                    but when the wicked perish, the righteous thrive.

            <p>
                                                          Whoever remains stiff-necked after many rebukes
                                                              will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy.

                                                          2 When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice;
                                                              when the wicked rule, the people groan.

                                                          3 A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,
                                                              but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.

                                                          4 By justice a king gives a country stability,
                                                              but those who are greedy for[a] bribes tear it down.

                                                          5 Those who flatter their neighbors
                                                              are spreading nets for their feet.

                                                          6 Evildoers are snared by their own sin,
                                                              but the righteous shout for joy and are glad.

                                                          7 The righteous care about justice for the poor,
                                                              but the wicked have no such concern.

                                                          8 Mockers stir up a city,
                                                              but the wise turn away anger.

                                                          9 If a wise person goes to court with a fool,
                                                              the fool rages and scoffs, and there is no peace.

                                                          10 The bloodthirsty hate a person of integrity
                                                              and seek to kill the upright.

                                                          11 Fools give full vent to their rage,
                                                              but the wise bring calm in the end.

                                                          12 If a ruler listens to lies,
                                                              all his officials become wicked.

                                                          13 The poor and the oppressor have this in common:
                                                              The Lord gives sight to the eyes of both.

                                                          14 If a king judges the poor with fairness,
                                                              his throne will be established forever.

                                                          15 A rod and a reprimand impart wisdom,
                                                              but a child left undisciplined disgraces its mother.

                                                          16 When the wicked thrive, so does sin,
                                                              but the righteous will see their downfall.

                                                          17 Discipline your children, and they will give you peace;
                                                              they will bring you the delights you desire.

                                                          18 Where there is no revelation, people cast off restraint;
                                                              but blessed is the one who heeds wisdom’s instruction.

                                                          19 Servants cannot be corrected by mere words;
                                                              though they understand, they will not respond.

                                                          20 Do you see someone who speaks in haste?
                                                              There is more hope for a fool than for them.

                                                          21 A servant pampered from youth
                                                              will turn out to be insolent.

                                                          22 An angry person stirs up conflict,
                                                              and a hot-tempered person commits many sins.

                                                          23 Pride brings a person low,
                                                              but the lowly in spirit gain honor.

                                                          24 The accomplices of thieves are their own enemies;
                                                              they are put under oath and dare not testify.

                                                          25 Fear of man will prove to be a snare,
                                                              but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe.

                                                          26 Many seek an audience with a ruler,
                                                              but it is from the Lord that one gets justice.

                                                          27 The righteous detest the dishonest;
                                                              the wicked detest the upright.

            <p>
                                        The sayings of Agur son of Jakeh—an inspired utterance.

                                        This man’s utterance to Ithiel:

                                        “I am weary, God,
                                            but I can prevail.[a]
                                        2 Surely I am only a brute, not a man;
                                            I do not have human understanding.
                                        3 I have not learned wisdom,
                                            nor have I attained to the knowledge of the Holy One.
                                        4 Who has gone up to heaven and come down?
                                            Whose hands have gathered up the wind?
                                        Who has wrapped up the waters in a cloak?
                                            Who has established all the ends of the earth?
                                        What is his name, and what is the name of his son?
                                            Surely you know!

                                        5 “Every word of God is flawless;
                                            he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
                                        6 Do not add to his words,
                                            or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.

                                        7 “Two things I ask of you, Lord;
                                            do not refuse me before I die:
                                        8 Keep falsehood and lies far from me;
                                            give me neither poverty nor riches,
                                            but give me only my daily bread.
                                        9 Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you
                                            and say, ‘Who is the Lord?’
                                        Or I may become poor and steal,
                                            and so dishonor the name of my God.

                                        10 “Do not slander a servant to their master,
                                            or they will curse you, and you will pay for it.

                                        11 “There are those who curse their fathers
                                            and do not bless their mothers;
                                        12 those who are pure in their own eyes
                                            and yet are not cleansed of their filth;
                                        13 those whose eyes are ever so haughty,
                                            whose glances are so disdainful;
                                        14 those whose teeth are swords
                                            and whose jaws are set with knives
                                        to devour the poor from the earth
                                            and the needy from among mankind.

                                        15 “The leech has two daughters.
                                            ‘Give! Give!’ they cry.

                                        “There are three things that are never satisfied,
                                            four that never say, ‘Enough!’:
                                        16 the grave, the barren womb,
                                            land, which is never satisfied with water,
                                            and fire, which never says, ‘Enough!’

                                        17 “The eye that mocks a father,
                                            that scorns an aged mother,
                                        will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley,
                                            will be eaten by the vultures.

                                        18 “There are three things that are too amazing for me,
                                            four that I do not understand:
                                        19 the way of an eagle in the sky,
                                            the way of a snake on a rock,
                                        the way of a ship on the high seas,
                                            and the way of a man with a young woman.

                                        20 “This is the way of an adulterous woman:
                                            She eats and wipes her mouth
                                            and says, ‘I’ve done nothing wrong.’

                                        21 “Under three things the earth trembles,
                                            under four it cannot bear up:
                                        22 a servant who becomes king,
                                            a godless fool who gets plenty to eat,
                                        23 a contemptible woman who gets married,
                                            and a servant who displaces her mistress.

                                        24 “Four things on earth are small,
                                            yet they are extremely wise:
                                        25 Ants are creatures of little strength,
                                            yet they store up their food in the summer;
                                        26 hyraxes are creatures of little power,
                                            yet they make their home in the crags;
                                        27 locusts have no king,
                                            yet they advance together in ranks;
                                        28 a lizard can be caught with the hand,
                                            yet it is found in kings’ palaces.

                                        29 “There are three things that are stately in their stride,
                                            four that move with stately bearing:
                                        30 a lion, mighty among beasts,
                                            who retreats before nothing;
                                        31 a strutting rooster, a he-goat,
                                            and a king secure against revolt.[b]

                                        32 “If you play the fool and exalt yourself,
                                            or if you plan evil,
                                            clap your hand over your mouth!
                                        33 For as churning cream produces butter,
                                            and as twisting the nose produces blood,
                                            so stirring up anger produces strife.”

            <p>
                                    The sayings of King Lemuel—an inspired utterance his mother taught him.

                                    2 Listen, my son! Listen, son of my womb!
                                        Listen, my son, the answer to my prayers!
                                    3 Do not spend your strength[a] on women,
                                        your vigor on those who ruin kings.

                                    4 It is not for kings, Lemuel—
                                        it is not for kings to drink wine,
                                        not for rulers to crave beer,
                                    5 lest they drink and forget what has been decreed,
                                        and deprive all the oppressed of their rights.
                                    6 Let beer be for those who are perishing,
                                        wine for those who are in anguish!
                                    7 Let them drink and forget their poverty
                                        and remember their misery no more.

                                    8 Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves,
                                        for the rights of all who are destitute.
                                    9 Speak up and judge fairly;
                                        defend the rights of the poor and needy.

                                    Epilogue: The Wife of Noble Character
                                    10 [b]A wife of noble character who can find?
                                        She is worth far more than rubies.
                                    11 Her husband has full confidence in her
                                        and lacks nothing of value.
                                    12 She brings him good, not harm,
                                        all the days of her life.
                                    13 She selects wool and flax
                                        and works with eager hands.
                                    14 She is like the merchant ships,
                                        bringing her food from afar.
                                    15 She gets up while it is still night;
                                        she provides food for her family
                                        and portions for her female servants.
                                    16 She considers a field and buys it;
                                        out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.
                                    17 She sets about her work vigorously;
                                        her arms are strong for her tasks.
                                    18 She sees that her trading is profitable,
                                        and her lamp does not go out at night.
                                    19 In her hand she holds the distaff
                                        and grasps the spindle with her fingers.
                                    20 She opens her arms to the poor
                                        and extends her hands to the needy.
                                    21 When it snows, she has no fear for her household;
                                        for all of them are clothed in scarlet.
                                    22 She makes coverings for her bed;
                                        she is clothed in fine linen and purple.
                                    23 Her husband is respected at the city gate,
                                        where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.
                                    24 She makes linen garments and sells them,
                                        and supplies the merchants with sashes.
                                    25 She is clothed with strength and dignity;
                                        she can laugh at the days to come.
                                    26 She speaks with wisdom,
                                        and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
                                    27 She watches over the affairs of her household
                                        and does not eat the bread of idleness.
                                    28 Her children arise and call her blessed;
                                        her husband also, and he praises her:
                                    29 “Many women do noble things,
                                        but you surpass them all.”
                                    30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting;
                                        but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
                                    31 Honor her for all that her hands have done,
                                        and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.

            <p>
Everything Is Meaningless
1 The words of the Teacher,[a] son of David, king in Jerusalem:

2 “Meaningless! Meaningless!”
    says the Teacher.
“Utterly meaningless!
    Everything is meaningless.”

3 What do people gain from all their labors
    at which they toil under the sun?
4 Generations come and generations go,
    but the earth remains forever.
5 The sun rises and the sun sets,
    and hurries back to where it rises.
6 The wind blows to the south
    and turns to the north;
round and round it goes,
    ever returning on its course.
7 All streams flow into the sea,
    yet the sea is never full.
To the place the streams come from,
    there they return again.
8 All things are wearisome,
    more than one can say.
The eye never has enough of seeing,
    nor the ear its fill of hearing.
9 What has been will be again,
    what has been done will be done again;
    there is nothing new under the sun.
10 Is there anything of which one can say,
    “Look! This is something new”?
It was here already, long ago;
    it was here before our time.
11 No one remembers the former generations,
    and even those yet to come
will not be remembered
    by those who follow them.

Wisdom Is Meaningless
12 I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13 I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! 14 I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

15 What is crooked cannot be straightened;
    what is lacking cannot be counted.

16 I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.” 17 Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.

18 For with much wisdom comes much sorrow;
    the more knowledge, the more grief.
            </p>

         <h2 className={styles.secondchapter}>  Ecclesiastes CH II</h2>
            <p>
Pleasures Are Meaningless
2 I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.” But that also proved to be meaningless. 2 “Laughter,” I said, “is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?” 3 I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.

4 I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. 5 I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 6 I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. 7 I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. 8 I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem[a] as well—the delights of a man’s heart. 9 I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.

10 I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;
    I refused my heart no pleasure.
My heart took delight in all my labor,
    and this was the reward for all my toil.
11 Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done
    and what I had toiled to achieve,
everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;
    nothing was gained under the sun.

Wisdom and Folly Are Meaningless
12 Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom,
    and also madness and folly.
What more can the king’s successor do
    than what has already been done?
13 I saw that wisdom is better than folly,
    just as light is better than darkness.
14 The wise have eyes in their heads,
    while the fool walks in the darkness;
but I came to realize
    that the same fate overtakes them both.

15 Then I said to myself,

“The fate of the fool will overtake me also.
    What then do I gain by being wise?”
I said to myself,
    “This too is meaningless.”
16 For the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered;
    the days have already come when both have been forgotten.
Like the fool, the wise too must die!

Toil Is Meaningless
17 So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. 18 I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. 19 And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. 20 So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. 21 For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. 22 What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? 23 All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.

24 A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, 25 for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment? 26 To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

            <p>
A Time for Everything
3 There is a time for everything,
    and a season for every activity under the heavens:

2     a time to be born and a time to die,
    a time to plant and a time to uproot,
3     a time to kill and a time to heal,
    a time to tear down and a time to build,
4     a time to weep and a time to laugh,
    a time to mourn and a time to dance,
5     a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,
    a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,
6     a time to search and a time to give up,
    a time to keep and a time to throw away,
7     a time to tear and a time to mend,
    a time to be silent and a time to speak,
8     a time to love and a time to hate,
    a time for war and a time for peace.

9 What do workers gain from their toil? 10 I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. 11 He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet[a] no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. 12 I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. 13 That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God. 14 I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that people will fear him.

15 Whatever is has already been,
    and what will be has been before;
    and God will call the past to account.[b]

16 And I saw something else under the sun:

In the place of judgment—wickedness was there,
    in the place of justice—wickedness was there.

17 I said to myself,

“God will bring into judgment
    both the righteous and the wicked,
for there will be a time for every activity,
    a time to judge every deed.”

18 I also said to myself, “As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. 19 Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath[c]; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless. 20 All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return. 21 Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”

22 So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?

Oppression, Toil, Friendlessness
4 Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun:

I saw the tears of the oppressed—
    and they have no comforter;
power was on the side of their oppressors—
    and they have no comforter.
2 And I declared that the dead,
    who had already died,
are happier than the living,
    who are still alive.
3 But better than both
    is the one who has never been born,
who has not seen the evil
    that is done under the sun.

4 And I saw that all toil and all achievement spring from one person’s envy of another. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

5 Fools fold their hands
    and ruin themselves.
6 Better one handful with tranquillity
    than two handfuls with toil
    and chasing after the wind.

7 Again I saw something meaningless under the sun:

8 There was a man all alone;
    he had neither son nor brother.
There was no end to his toil,
    yet his eyes were not content with his wealth.
“For whom am I toiling,” he asked,
    “and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?”
This too is meaningless—
    a miserable business!

9 Two are better than one,
    because they have a good return for their labor:
10 If either of them falls down,
    one can help the other up.
But pity anyone who falls
    and has no one to help them up.
11 Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm.
    But how can one keep warm alone?
12 Though one may be overpowered,
    two can defend themselves.
A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.

Advancement Is Meaningless
13 Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to heed a warning. 14 The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom. 15 I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king’s successor. 16 There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

Fulfill Your Vow to God
5 [a]Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong.

2 Do not be quick with your mouth,
    do not be hasty in your heart
    to utter anything before God.
God is in heaven
    and you are on earth,
    so let your words be few.
3 A dream comes when there are many cares,
    and many words mark the speech of a fool.

4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. 5 It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it. 6 Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, “My vow was a mistake.” Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands? 7 Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore fear God.

Riches Are Meaningless
8 If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still. 9 The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields.

10 Whoever loves money never has enough;
    whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income.
    This too is meaningless.

11 As goods increase,
    so do those who consume them.
And what benefit are they to the owners
    except to feast their eyes on them?

12 The sleep of a laborer is sweet,
    whether they eat little or much,
but as for the rich, their abundance
    permits them no sleep.

13 I have seen a grievous evil under the sun:

wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners,
14     or wealth lost through some misfortune,
so that when they have children
    there is nothing left for them to inherit.
15 Everyone comes naked from their mother’s womb,
    and as everyone comes, so they depart.
They take nothing from their toil
    that they can carry in their hands.

16 This too is a grievous evil:

As everyone comes, so they depart,
    and what do they gain,
    since they toil for the wind?
17 All their days they eat in darkness,
    with great frustration, affliction and anger.

18 This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot. 19 Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God. 20 They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart.

6 I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on mankind: 2 God gives some people wealth, possessions and honor, so that they lack nothing their hearts desire, but God does not grant them the ability to enjoy them, and strangers enjoy them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.

3 A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he. 4 It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded. 5 Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man— 6 even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?

7 Everyone’s toil is for their mouth,
    yet their appetite is never satisfied.
8 What advantage have the wise over fools?
What do the poor gain
    by knowing how to conduct themselves before others?
9 Better what the eye sees
    than the roving of the appetite.
This too is meaningless,
    a chasing after the wind.

10 Whatever exists has already been named,
    and what humanity is has been known;
no one can contend
    with someone who is stronger.
11 The more the words,
    the less the meaning,
    and how does that profit anyone?

12 For who knows what is good for a person in life, during the few and meaningless days they pass through like a shadow? Who can tell them what will happen under the sun after they are gone?

Wisdom
 A good name is better than fine perfume,
    and the day of death better than the day of birth.
2 It is better to go to a house of mourning
    than to go to a house of feasting,
for death is the destiny of everyone;
    the living should take this to heart.
3 Frustration is better than laughter,
    because a sad face is good for the heart.
4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
    but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
5 It is better to heed the rebuke of a wise person
    than to listen to the song of fools.
6 Like the crackling of thorns under the pot,
    so is the laughter of fools.
    This too is meaningless.

7 Extortion turns a wise person into a fool,
    and a bribe corrupts the heart.

8 The end of a matter is better than its beginning,
    and patience is better than pride.
9 Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit,
    for anger resides in the lap of fools.

10 Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?”
    For it is not wise to ask such questions.

11 Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing
    and benefits those who see the sun.
12 Wisdom is a shelter
    as money is a shelter,
but the advantage of knowledge is this:
    Wisdom preserves those who have it.

13 Consider what God has done:

Who can straighten
    what he has made crooked?
14 When times are good, be happy;
    but when times are bad, consider this:
God has made the one
    as well as the other.
Therefore, no one can discover
    anything about their future.

15 In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these:

the righteous perishing in their righteousness,
    and the wicked living long in their wickedness.
16 Do not be overrighteous,
    neither be overwise—
    why destroy yourself?
17 Do not be overwicked,
    and do not be a fool—
    why die before your time?
18 It is good to grasp the one
    and not let go of the other.
    Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.[a]

19 Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful
    than ten rulers in a city.

20 Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous,
    no one who does what is right and never sins.

21 Do not pay attention to every word people say,
    or you may hear your servant cursing you—
22 for you know in your heart
    that many times you yourself have cursed others.

23 All this I tested by wisdom and I said,

“I am determined to be wise”—
    but this was beyond me.
24 Whatever exists is far off and most profound—
    who can discover it?
25 So I turned my mind to understand,
    to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things
and to understand the stupidity of wickedness
    and the madness of folly.

26 I find more bitter than death
    the woman who is a snare,
whose heart is a trap
    and whose hands are chains.
The man who pleases God will escape her,
    but the sinner she will ensnare.

27 “Look,” says the Teacher,[b] “this is what I have discovered:

“Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things—
28     while I was still searching
    but not finding—
I found one upright man among a thousand,
    but not one upright woman among them all.
29 This only have I found:
    God created mankind upright,
    but they have gone in search of many schemes.”

         <h2 className={styles.secondchapter}> Ecclesiastes CH VIII</h2>
            <p>
Who is like the wise?
    Who knows the explanation of things?
A person’s wisdom brightens their face
    and changes its hard appearance.

Obey the King
2 Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took an oath before God. 3 Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases. 4 Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, “What are you doing?”

5 Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm,
    and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.
6 For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,
    though a person may be weighed down by misery.

7 Since no one knows the future,
    who can tell someone else what is to come?
8 As no one has power over the wind to contain it,
    so[a] no one has power over the time of their death.
As no one is discharged in time of war,
    so wickedness will not release those who practice it.

9 All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own[b] hurt. 10 Then too, I saw the wicked buried—those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise[c] in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless.

11 When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people’s hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong. 12 Although a wicked person who commits a hundred crimes may live a long time, I know that it will go better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him. 13 Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.

14 There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless. 15 So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun.

16 When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night— 17 then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it.

            <p>
A Common Destiny for All
9 So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God’s hands, but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them. 2 All share a common destiny—the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad,[a] the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not.

As it is with the good,
    so with the sinful;
as it is with those who take oaths,
    so with those who are afraid to take them.

3 This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead. 4 Anyone who is among the living has hope[b]—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!

5 For the living know that they will die,
    but the dead know nothing;
they have no further reward,
    and even their name is forgotten.
6 Their love, their hate
    and their jealousy have long since vanished;
never again will they have a part
    in anything that happens under the sun.

7 Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do. 8 Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil. 9 Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun—all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun. 10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.

11 I have seen something else under the sun:

The race is not to the swift
    or the battle to the strong,
nor does food come to the wise
    or wealth to the brilliant
    or favor to the learned;
but time and chance happen to them all.

12 Moreover, no one knows when their hour will come:

As fish are caught in a cruel net,
    or birds are taken in a snare,
so people are trapped by evil times
    that fall unexpectedly upon them.

Wisdom Better Than Folly
13 I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me: 14 There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it. 15 Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man. 16 So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.

17 The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded
    than the shouts of a ruler of fools.
18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
    but one sinner destroys much good.

            <p>
As dead flies give perfume a bad smell,
    so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
2 The heart of the wise inclines to the right,
    but the heart of the fool to the left.
3 Even as fools walk along the road,
    they lack sense
    and show everyone how stupid they are.
4 If a ruler’s anger rises against you,
    do not leave your post;
    calmness can lay great offenses to rest.

5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun,
    the sort of error that arises from a ruler:
6 Fools are put in many high positions,
    while the rich occupy the low ones.
7 I have seen slaves on horseback,
    while princes go on foot like slaves.

8 Whoever digs a pit may fall into it;
    whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
9 Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them;
    whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.

10 If the ax is dull
    and its edge unsharpened,
more strength is needed,
    but skill will bring success.

11 If a snake bites before it is charmed,
    the charmer receives no fee.

12 Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious,
    but fools are consumed by their own lips.
13 At the beginning their words are folly;
    at the end they are wicked madness—
14     and fools multiply words.

No one knows what is coming—
    who can tell someone else what will happen after them?

15 The toil of fools wearies them;
    they do not know the way to town.

16 Woe to the land whose king was a servant[a]
    and whose princes feast in the morning.
17 Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth
    and whose princes eat at a proper time—
    for strength and not for drunkenness.

18 Through laziness, the rafters sag;
    because of idle hands, the house leaks.

19 A feast is made for laughter,
    wine makes life merry,
    and money is the answer for everything.

20 Do not revile the king even in your thoughts,
    or curse the rich in your bedroom,
because a bird in the sky may carry your words,
    and a bird on the wing may report what you say.

Invest in Many Ventures
11 Ship your grain across the sea;
    after many days you may receive a return.
2 Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight;
    you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.

3 If clouds are full of water,
    they pour rain on the earth.
Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north,
    in the place where it falls, there it will lie.
4 Whoever watches the wind will not plant;
    whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.

5 As you do not know the path of the wind,
    or how the body is formed[a] in a mother’s womb,
so you cannot understand the work of God,
    the Maker of all things.

6 Sow your seed in the morning,
    and at evening let your hands not be idle,
for you do not know which will succeed,
    whether this or that,
    or whether both will do equally well.

Remember Your Creator While Young
7 Light is sweet,
    and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.
8 However many years anyone may live,
    let them enjoy them all.
But let them remember the days of darkness,
    for there will be many.
    Everything to come is meaningless.

9 You who are young, be happy while you are young,
    and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth.
Follow the ways of your heart
    and whatever your eyes see,
but know that for all these things
    God will bring you into judgment.
10 So then, banish anxiety from your heart
    and cast off the troubles of your body,
    for youth and vigor are meaningless.

Remember your Creator
    in the days of your youth,
before the days of trouble come
    and the years approach when you will say,
    “I find no pleasure in them”—
2 before the sun and the light
    and the moon and the stars grow dark,
    and the clouds return after the rain;
3 when the keepers of the house tremble,
    and the strong men stoop,
when the grinders cease because they are few,
    and those looking through the windows grow dim;
4 when the doors to the street are closed
    and the sound of grinding fades;
when people rise up at the sound of birds,
    but all their songs grow faint;
5 when people are afraid of heights
    and of dangers in the streets;
when the almond tree blossoms
    and the grasshopper drags itself along
    and desire no longer is stirred.
Then people go to their eternal home
    and mourners go about the streets.

6 Remember him—before the silver cord is severed,
    and the golden bowl is broken;
before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,
    and the wheel broken at the well,
7 and the dust returns to the ground it came from,
    and the spirit returns to God who gave it.

8 “Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher.[a]
    “Everything is meaningless!”

The Conclusion of the Matter
9 Not only was the Teacher wise, but he also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs. 10 The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.

11 The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one shepherd.[b] 12 Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them.

Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.

13 Now all has been heard;
    here is the conclusion of the matter:
Fear God and keep his commandments,
    for this is the duty of all mankind.
14 For God will bring every deed into judgment,
    including every hidden thing,
    whether it is good or evil.

         <h2 className={styles.thirdchapter}> Job Chapter I</h2>
            <p>
Prologue
1 In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. 2 He had seven sons and three daughters, 3 and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.

4 His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 5 When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom.

6 One day the angels[a] came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan[b] also came with them. 7 The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”

Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”

8 Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”

9 “Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. 10 “Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.”

12 The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.”

Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.

13 One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, 14 a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, 15 and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”

16 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”

17 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”

18 While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, 19 when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”

20 At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship 21 and said:

“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
    and naked I will depart.[c]
The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away;
    may the name of the Lord be praised.”

22 In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.

            <p>
2 On another day the angels[a] came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him. 2 And the Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”

Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”

3 Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.”

4 “Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life. 5 But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.”

6 The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life.”

7 So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. 8 Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.

9 His wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”

10 He replied, “You are talking like a foolish[b] woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?”

In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.

11 When Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him. 12 When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads. 13 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.

Job Speaks
3 After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 2 He said:

3 “May the day of my birth perish,
    and the night that said, ‘A boy is conceived!’
4 That day—may it turn to darkness;
    may God above not care about it;
    may no light shine on it.
5 May gloom and utter darkness claim it once more;
    may a cloud settle over it;
    may blackness overwhelm it.
6 That night—may thick darkness seize it;
    may it not be included among the days of the year
    nor be entered in any of the months.
7 May that night be barren;
    may no shout of joy be heard in it.
8 May those who curse days[a] curse that day,
    those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
9 May its morning stars become dark;
    may it wait for daylight in vain
    and not see the first rays of dawn,
10 for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me
    to hide trouble from my eyes.

11 “Why did I not perish at birth,
    and die as I came from the womb?
12 Why were there knees to receive me
    and breasts that I might be nursed?
13 For now I would be lying down in peace;
    I would be asleep and at rest
14 with kings and rulers of the earth,
    who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,
15 with princes who had gold,
    who filled their houses with silver.
16 Or why was I not hidden away in the ground like a stillborn child,
    like an infant who never saw the light of day?
17 There the wicked cease from turmoil,
    and there the weary are at rest.
18 Captives also enjoy their ease;
    they no longer hear the slave driver’s shout.
19 The small and the great are there,
    and the slaves are freed from their owners.

20 “Why is light given to those in misery,
    and life to the bitter of soul,
21 to those who long for death that does not come,
    who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
22 who are filled with gladness
    and rejoice when they reach the grave?
23 Why is life given to a man
    whose way is hidden,
    whom God has hedged in?
24 For sighing has become my daily food;
    my groans pour out like water.
25 What I feared has come upon me;
    what I dreaded has happened to me.
26 I have no peace, no quietness;
    I have no rest, but only turmoil.”

Eliphaz
4 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:

2 “If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient?
    But who can keep from speaking?
3 Think how you have instructed many,
    how you have strengthened feeble hands.
4 Your words have supported those who stumbled;
    you have strengthened faltering knees.
5 But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged;
    it strikes you, and you are dismayed.
6 Should not your piety be your confidence
    and your blameless ways your hope?

7 “Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished?
    Where were the upright ever destroyed?
8 As I have observed, those who plow evil
    and those who sow trouble reap it.
9 At the breath of God they perish;
    at the blast of his anger they are no more.
10 The lions may roar and growl,
    yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.
11 The lion perishes for lack of prey,
    and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

12 “A word was secretly brought to me,
    my ears caught a whisper of it.
13 Amid disquieting dreams in the night,
    when deep sleep falls on people,
14 fear and trembling seized me
    and made all my bones shake.
15 A spirit glided past my face,
    and the hair on my body stood on end.
16 It stopped,
    but I could not tell what it was.
A form stood before my eyes,
    and I heard a hushed voice:
17 ‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God?
    Can even a strong man be more pure than his Maker?
18 If God places no trust in his servants,
    if he charges his angels with error,
19 how much more those who live in houses of clay,
    whose foundations are in the dust,
    who are crushed more readily than a moth!
20 Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces;
    unnoticed, they perish forever.
21 Are not the cords of their tent pulled up,
    so that they die without wisdom?’

5 “Call if you will, but who will answer you?
    To which of the holy ones will you turn?
2 Resentment kills a fool,
    and envy slays the simple.
3 I myself have seen a fool taking root,
    but suddenly his house was cursed.
4 His children are far from safety,
    crushed in court without a defender.
5 The hungry consume his harvest,
    taking it even from among thorns,
    and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
6 For hardship does not spring from the soil,
    nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
7 Yet man is born to trouble
    as surely as sparks fly upward.

8 “But if I were you, I would appeal to God;
    I would lay my cause before him.
9 He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed,
    miracles that cannot be counted.
10 He provides rain for the earth;
    he sends water on the countryside.
11 The lowly he sets on high,
    and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
12 He thwarts the plans of the crafty,
    so that their hands achieve no success.
13 He catches the wise in their craftiness,
    and the schemes of the wily are swept away.
14 Darkness comes upon them in the daytime;
    at noon they grope as in the night.
15 He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth;
    he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
16 So the poor have hope,
    and injustice shuts its mouth.

17 “Blessed is the one whom God corrects;
    so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.[a]
18 For he wounds, but he also binds up;
    he injures, but his hands also heal.
19 From six calamities he will rescue you;
    in seven no harm will touch you.
20 In famine he will deliver you from death,
    and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
21 You will be protected from the lash of the tongue,
    and need not fear when destruction comes.
22 You will laugh at destruction and famine,
    and need not fear the wild animals.
23 For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field,
    and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
24 You will know that your tent is secure;
    you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
25 You will know that your children will be many,
    and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
26 You will come to the grave in full vigor,
    like sheaves gathered in season.

27 “We have examined this, and it is true.
    So hear it and apply it to yourself.”

Job
6 Then Job replied:

2 “If only my anguish could be weighed
    and all my misery be placed on the scales!
3 It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas—
    no wonder my words have been impetuous.
4 The arrows of the Almighty are in me,
    my spirit drinks in their poison;
    God’s terrors are marshaled against me.
5 Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass,
    or an ox bellow when it has fodder?
6 Is tasteless food eaten without salt,
    or is there flavor in the sap of the mallow[a]?
7 I refuse to touch it;
    such food makes me ill.

8 “Oh, that I might have my request,
    that God would grant what I hope for,
9 that God would be willing to crush me,
    to let loose his hand and cut off my life!
10 Then I would still have this consolation—
    my joy in unrelenting pain—
    that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.

11 “What strength do I have, that I should still hope?
    What prospects, that I should be patient?
12 Do I have the strength of stone?
    Is my flesh bronze?
13 Do I have any power to help myself,
    now that success has been driven from me?

14 “Anyone who withholds kindness from a friend
    forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
15 But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams,
    as the streams that overflow
16 when darkened by thawing ice
    and swollen with melting snow,
17 but that stop flowing in the dry season,
    and in the heat vanish from their channels.
18 Caravans turn aside from their routes;
    they go off into the wasteland and perish.
19 The caravans of Tema look for water,
    the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
20 They are distressed, because they had been confident;
    they arrive there, only to be disappointed.
21 Now you too have proved to be of no help;
    you see something dreadful and are afraid.
22 Have I ever said, ‘Give something on my behalf,
    pay a ransom for me from your wealth,
23 deliver me from the hand of the enemy,
    rescue me from the clutches of the ruthless’?

24 “Teach me, and I will be quiet;
    show me where I have been wrong.
25 How painful are honest words!
    But what do your arguments prove?
26 Do you mean to correct what I say,
    and treat my desperate words as wind?
27 You would even cast lots for the fatherless
    and barter away your friend.

28 “But now be so kind as to look at me.
    Would I lie to your face?
29 Relent, do not be unjust;
    reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.[b]

7 “Do not mortals have hard service on earth?
    Are not their days like those of hired laborers?
2 Like a slave longing for the evening shadows,
    or a hired laborer waiting to be paid,
3 so I have been allotted months of futility,
    and nights of misery have been assigned to me.
4 When I lie down I think, ‘How long before I get up?’
    The night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.
5 My body is clothed with worms and scabs,
    my skin is broken and festering.

6 “My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,
    and they come to an end without hope.
7 Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath;
    my eyes will never see happiness again.
8 The eye that now sees me will see me no longer;
    you will look for me, but I will be no more.
9 As a cloud vanishes and is gone,
    so one who goes down to the grave does not return.
10 He will never come to his house again;
    his place will know him no more.

11 “Therefore I will not keep silent;
    I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit,
    I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
12 Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep,
    that you put me under guard?
13 When I think my bed will comfort me
    and my couch will ease my complaint,
14 even then you frighten me with dreams
    and terrify me with visions,
15 so that I prefer strangling and death,
    rather than this body of mine.
16 I despise my life; I would not live forever.
    Let me alone; my days have no meaning.

17 “What is mankind that you make so much of them,
    that you give them so much attention,
18 that you examine them every morning
    and test them every moment?
19 Will you never look away from me,
    or let me alone even for an instant?
20 If I have sinned, what have I done to you,
    you who see everything we do?
Why have you made me your target?
    Have I become a burden to you?[a]
21 Why do you not pardon my offenses
    and forgive my sins?
For I will soon lie down in the dust;
    you will search for me, but I will be no more.”

Bildad
8 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:

2 “How long will you say such things?
    Your words are a blustering wind.
3 Does God pervert justice?
    Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
4 When your children sinned against him,
    he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
5 But if you will seek God earnestly
    and plead with the Almighty,
6 if you are pure and upright,
    even now he will rouse himself on your behalf
    and restore you to your prosperous state.
7 Your beginnings will seem humble,
    so prosperous will your future be.

8 “Ask the former generation
    and find out what their ancestors learned,
9 for we were born only yesterday and know nothing,
    and our days on earth are but a shadow.
10 Will they not instruct you and tell you?
    Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?
11 Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh?
    Can reeds thrive without water?
12 While still growing and uncut,
    they wither more quickly than grass.
13 Such is the destiny of all who forget God;
    so perishes the hope of the godless.
14 What they trust in is fragile[a];
    what they rely on is a spider’s web.
15 They lean on the web, but it gives way;
    they cling to it, but it does not hold.
16 They are like a well-watered plant in the sunshine,
    spreading its shoots over the garden;
17 it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks
    and looks for a place among the stones.
18 But when it is torn from its spot,
    that place disowns it and says, ‘I never saw you.’
19 Surely its life withers away,
    and[b] from the soil other plants grow.

20 “Surely God does not reject one who is blameless
    or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
21 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter
    and your lips with shouts of joy.
22 Your enemies will be clothed in shame,

Job
9 Then Job replied:

2 “Indeed, I know that this is true.
    But how can mere mortals prove their innocence before God?
3 Though they wished to dispute with him,
    they could not answer him one time out of a thousand.
4 His wisdom is profound, his power is vast.
    Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?
5 He moves mountains without their knowing it
    and overturns them in his anger.
6 He shakes the earth from its place
    and makes its pillars tremble.
7 He speaks to the sun and it does not shine;
    he seals off the light of the stars.
8 He alone stretches out the heavens
    and treads on the waves of the sea.
9 He is the Maker of the Bear[a] and Orion,
    the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
10 He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed,
    miracles that cannot be counted.
11 When he passes me, I cannot see him;
    when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
12 If he snatches away, who can stop him?
    Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’
13 God does not restrain his anger;
    even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.

14 “How then can I dispute with him?
    How can I find words to argue with him?
15 Though I were innocent, I could not answer him;
    I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.
16 Even if I summoned him and he responded,
    I do not believe he would give me a hearing.
17 He would crush me with a storm
    and multiply my wounds for no reason.
18 He would not let me catch my breath
    but would overwhelm me with misery.
19 If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty!
    And if it is a matter of justice, who can challenge him[b]?
20 Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me;
    if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.

21 “Although I am blameless,
    I have no concern for myself;
    I despise my own life.
22 It is all the same; that is why I say,
    ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’
23 When a scourge brings sudden death,
    he mocks the despair of the innocent.
24 When a land falls into the hands of the wicked,
    he blindfolds its judges.
    If it is not he, then who is it?

25 “My days are swifter than a runner;
    they fly away without a glimpse of joy.
26 They skim past like boats of papyrus,
    like eagles swooping down on their prey.
27 If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
    I will change my expression, and smile,’
28 I still dread all my sufferings,
    for I know you will not hold me innocent.
29 Since I am already found guilty,
    why should I struggle in vain?
30 Even if I washed myself with soap
    and my hands with cleansing powder,
31 you would plunge me into a slime pit
    so that even my clothes would detest me.

32 “He is not a mere mortal like me that I might answer him,
    that we might confront each other in court.
33 If only there were someone to mediate between us,
    someone to bring us together,
34 someone to remove God’s rod from me,
    so that his terror would frighten me no more.
35 Then I would speak up without fear of him,
    but as it now stands with me, I cannot.

3 Does it please you to oppress me,

9 Remember that you molded me like clay.

10 Did you not pour me out like milk

7 “Can you fathom the mysteries of God?
    Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
8 They are higher than the heavens above—what can you do?
    They are deeper than the depths below—what can you know?
9 Their measure is longer than the earth

2 What you know, I also know;
    I am not inferior to you.
3 But I desire to speak to the Almighty
    and to argue my case with God.
4 You, however, smear me with lies;
    you are worthless physicians, all of you!
5 If only you would be altogether silent!
    For you, that would be wisdom.
6 Hear now my argument;
    listen to the pleas of my lips.
7 Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf?
    Will you speak deceitfully for him?
8 Will you show him partiality?
    Will you argue the case for God?
9 Would it turn out well if he examined you?
    Could you deceive him as you might deceive a mortal?
10 He would surely call you to account
    if you secretly showed partiality.
11 Would not his splendor terrify you?
    Would not the dread of him fall on you?
12 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes;
    your defenses are defenses of clay.

13 “Keep silent and let me speak;
    then let come to me what may.
14 Why do I put myself in jeopardy
    and take my life in my hands?
15 Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him;
    I will surely[a] defend my ways to his face.
16 Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance,
    for no godless person would dare come before him!
17 Listen carefully to what I say;
    let my words ring in your ears.
18 Now that I have prepared my case,
    I know I will be vindicated.
19 Can anyone bring charges against me?
    If so, I will be silent and die.

20 “Only grant me these two things, God,
    and then I will not hide from you:
21 Withdraw your hand far from me,
    and stop frightening me with your terrors.
22 Then summon me and I will answer,
    or let me speak, and you reply to me.
23 How many wrongs and sins have I committed?
    Show me my offense and my sin.
24 Why do you hide your face
    and consider me your enemy?
25 Will you torment a windblown leaf?
    Will you chase after dry chaff?
26 For you write down bitter things against me
    and make me reap the sins of my youth.
27 You fasten my feet in shackles;
    you keep close watch on all my paths
    by putting marks on the soles of my feet.

28 “So man wastes away like something rotten,
    like a garment eaten by moths.

            <p> 14 “Mortals, born of woman,
    are of few days and full of trouble.
2 They spring up like flowers and wither away;
    like fleeting shadows, they do not endure.
3 Do you fix your eye on them?
    Will you bring them[a] before you for judgment?
4 Who can bring what is pure from the impure?
    No one!
5 A person’s days are determined;
    you have decreed the number of his months
    and have set limits he cannot exceed.
6 So look away from him and let him alone,
    till he has put in his time like a hired laborer.

7 “At least there is hope for a tree:
    If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
    and its new shoots will not fail.
8 Its roots may grow old in the ground
    and its stump die in the soil,
9 yet at the scent of water it will bud
    and put forth shoots like a plant.
10 But a man dies and is laid low;
    he breathes his last and is no more.
11 As the water of a lake dries up
    or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,
12 so he lies down and does not rise;
    till the heavens are no more, people will not awake
    or be roused from their sleep.

13 “If only you would hide me in the grave
    and conceal me till your anger has passed!
If only you would set me a time
    and then remember me!
14 If someone dies, will they live again?
    All the days of my hard service
    I will wait for my renewal[b] to come.
15 You will call and I will answer you;
    you will long for the creature your hands have made.
16 Surely then you will count my steps
    but not keep track of my sin.
17 My offenses will be sealed up in a bag;
    you will cover over my sin.

18 “But as a mountain erodes and crumbles
    and as a rock is moved from its place,
19 as water wears away stones
    and torrents wash away the soil,
    so you destroy a person’s hope.
20 You overpower them once for all, and they are gone;
    you change their countenance and send them away.
21 If their children are honored, they do not know it;
    if their offspring are brought low, they do not see it.
22 They feel but the pain of their own bodies
    and mourn only for themselves.”

15 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:

2 “Would a wise person answer with empty notions
    or fill their belly with the hot east wind?
3 Would they argue with useless words,
    with speeches that have no value?
4 But you even undermine piety
    and hinder devotion to God.
5 Your sin prompts your mouth;
    you adopt the tongue of the crafty.
6 Your own mouth condemns you, not mine;
    your own lips testify against you.

7 “Are you the first man ever born?
    Were you brought forth before the hills?
8 Do you listen in on God’s council?
    Do you have a monopoly on wisdom?
9 What do you know that we do not know?
    What insights do you have that we do not have?
10 The gray-haired and the aged are on our side,
    men even older than your father.
11 Are God’s consolations not enough for you,
    words spoken gently to you?
12 Why has your heart carried you away,
    and why do your eyes flash,
13 so that you vent your rage against God
    and pour out such words from your mouth?

14 “What are mortals, that they could be pure,
    or those born of woman, that they could be righteous?
15 If God places no trust in his holy ones,
    if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,
16 how much less mortals, who are vile and corrupt,
    who drink up evil like water!

17 “Listen to me and I will explain to you;
    let me tell you what I have seen,
18 what the wise have declared,
    hiding nothing received from their ancestors
19 (to whom alone the land was given
    when no foreigners moved among them):
20 All his days the wicked man suffers torment,
    the ruthless man through all the years stored up for him.
21 Terrifying sounds fill his ears;
    when all seems well, marauders attack him.
22 He despairs of escaping the realm of darkness;
    he is marked for the sword.
23 He wanders about for food like a vulture;
    he knows the day of darkness is at hand.
24 Distress and anguish fill him with terror;
    troubles overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,
25 because he shakes his fist at God
    and vaunts himself against the Almighty,
26 defiantly charging against him
    with a thick, strong shield.

27 “Though his face is covered with fat
    and his waist bulges with flesh,
28 he will inhabit ruined towns
    and houses where no one lives,
    houses crumbling to rubble.
29 He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure,
    nor will his possessions spread over the land.
30 He will not escape the darkness;
    a flame will wither his shoots,
    and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.
31 Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless,
    for he will get nothing in return.
32 Before his time he will wither,
    and his branches will not flourish.
33 He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes,
    like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.
34 For the company of the godless will be barren,
    and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.
35 They conceive trouble and give birth to evil;
    their womb fashions deceit.”

4 I also could speak like you,

I could make fine speeches against you
    and shake my head at you.
5 But my mouth would encourage you;
    comfort from my lips would bring you relief.

6 “Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved;
    and if I refrain, it does not go away.
7 Surely, God, you have worn me out;
    you have devastated my entire household.
8 You have shriveled me up—and it has become a witness;

9 God assails me and tears me in his anger

    my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.
10 People open their mouths to jeer at me;
    they strike my cheek in scorn

11 God has turned me over to the ungodly
    and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.
12 All was well with me, but he shattered me;
    he seized me by the neck and crushed me.
He has made me his target;
13     his archers surround me.
Without pity, he pierces my kidneys

14 Again and again he bursts upon me;
    he rushes at me like a warrior.

15 “I have sewed sackcloth over my skin
    and buried my brow in the dust.
16 My face is red with weeping,
    dark shadows ring my eyes;
17 yet my hands have been free of violence
    and my prayer is pure.

18 “Earth, do not cover my blood;

9 He has stripped me of my honor

13 “He has alienated my family from me;

14 My relatives have gone away;
    my closest friends have forgotten me.
15 My guests and my female servants count me a foreigner;
    they look on me as on a stranger.

    Why should I not be impatient?
5 Look at me and be appalled;
    clap your hand over your mouth.
6 When I think about this, I am terrified;

7 Why do the wicked live on,
    growing old and increasing in power?
8 They see their children established around them,

10 Their bulls never fail to breed;

    How often does calamity come upon them,

18 How often are they like straw before the wind,

    when their allotted months come to an end?

    completely secure and at ease,
24 well nourished in body,[b]
    bones rich with marrow.
25 Another dies in bitterness of soul,
    never having enjoyed anything good.
26 Side by side they lie in the dust,
    and worms cover them both.

27 “I know full well what you are thinking,

28 You say, ‘Where now is the house of the great,
    the tents where the wicked lived?’
29 Have you never questioned those who travel?

30 that the wicked are spared from the day of calamity,
    that they are delivered from[c] the day of wrath?
31 Who denounces their conduct to their face?
    Who repays them for what they have done?

    in this way prosperity will come to you.
22 Accept instruction from his mouth
    and lay up his words in your heart.
23 If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored:
    If you remove wickedness far from your tent
24 and assign your nuggets to the dust,
    your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,
25 then the Almighty will be your gold,
    the choicest silver for you.
26 Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty
    and will lift up your face to God.
27 You will pray to him, and he will hear you,
    and you will fulfill your vows.
28 What you decide on will be done,
    and light will shine on your ways.
29 When people are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’
    then he will save the downcast.
30 He will deliver even one who is not innocent,
    who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”

23 Then Job replied:

2 “Even today my complaint is bitter;
    his hand[a] is heavy in spite of[b] my groaning.
3 If only I knew where to find him;
    if only I could go to his dwelling!
4 I would state my case before him
    and fill my mouth with arguments.
5 I would find out what he would answer me,
    and consider what he would say to me.
6 Would he vigorously oppose me?
    No, he would not press charges against me.
7 There the upright can establish their innocence before him,
    and there I would be delivered forever from my judge.

8 “But if I go to the east, he is not there;
    if I go to the west, I do not find him.
9 When he is at work in the north, I do not see him;
    when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.
10 But he knows the way that I take;
    when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
11 My feet have closely followed his steps;
    I have kept to his way without turning aside.
12 I have not departed from the commands of his lips;
    I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.

13 “But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?
    He does whatever he pleases.
14 He carries out his decree against me,
    and many such plans he still has in store.
15 That is why I am terrified before him;
    when I think of all this, I fear him.
16 God has made my heart faint;
    the Almighty has terrified me.
17 Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,
    by the thick darkness that covers my face.

            <p> 24 “Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment?
    Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?
2 There are those who move boundary stones;
    they pasture flocks they have stolen.
3 They drive away the orphan’s donkey
    and take the widow’s ox in pledge.
4 They thrust the needy from the path
    and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
5 Like wild donkeys in the desert,
    the poor go about their labor of foraging food;
    the wasteland provides food for their children.
6 They gather fodder in the fields
    and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
7 Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked;
    they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.
8 They are drenched by mountain rains
    and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.
9 The fatherless child is snatched from the breast;
    the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.
10 Lacking clothes, they go about naked;
    they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
11 They crush olives among the terraces[a];
    they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.
12 The groans of the dying rise from the city,
    and the souls of the wounded cry out for help.
    But God charges no one with wrongdoing.

13 “There are those who rebel against the light,
    who do not know its ways
    or stay in its paths.
14 When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up,
    kills the poor and needy,
    and in the night steals forth like a thief.
15 The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk;
    he thinks, ‘No eye will see me,’
    and he keeps his face concealed.
16 In the dark, thieves break into houses,
    but by day they shut themselves in;
    they want nothing to do with the light.
17 For all of them, midnight is their morning;
    they make friends with the terrors of darkness.

18 “Yet they are foam on the surface of the water;
    their portion of the land is cursed,
    so that no one goes to the vineyards.
19 As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow,
    so the grave snatches away those who have sinned.
20 The womb forgets them,
    the worm feasts on them;
the wicked are no longer remembered
    but are broken like a tree.
21 They prey on the barren and childless woman,
    and to the widow they show no kindness.
22 But God drags away the mighty by his power;
    though they become established, they have no assurance of life.
23 He may let them rest in a feeling of security,
    but his eyes are on their ways.
24 For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone;
    they are brought low and gathered up like all others;
    they are cut off like heads of grain.

25 “If this is not so, who can prove me false
    and reduce my words to nothing?”

27 And Job continued his discourse:

2 “As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice,
    the Almighty, who has made my life bitter,
3 as long as I have life within me,
    the breath of God in my nostrils,
4 my lips will not say anything wicked,
    and my tongue will not utter lies.
5 I will never admit you are in the right;
    till I die, I will not deny my integrity.
6 I will maintain my innocence and never let go of it;
    my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.

7 “May my enemy be like the wicked,
    my adversary like the unjust!
8 For what hope have the godless when they are cut off,
    when God takes away their life?
9 Does God listen to their cry
    when distress comes upon them?
10 Will they find delight in the Almighty?
    Will they call on God at all times?

11 “I will teach you about the power of God;
    the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.
12 You have all seen this yourselves.
    Why then this meaningless talk?

13 “Here is the fate God allots to the wicked,
    the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty:
14 However many his children, their fate is the sword;
    his offspring will never have enough to eat.
15 The plague will bury those who survive him,
    and their widows will not weep for them.
16 Though he heaps up silver like dust
    and clothes like piles of clay,
17 what he lays up the righteous will wear,
    and the innocent will divide his silver.
18 The house he builds is like a moth’s cocoon,
    like a hut made by a watchman.
19 He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more;
    when he opens his eyes, all is gone.
20 Terrors overtake him like a flood;
    a tempest snatches him away in the night.
21 The east wind carries him off, and he is gone;
    it sweeps him out of his place.
22 It hurls itself against him without mercy
    as he flees headlong from its power.
23 It claps its hands in derision
    and hisses him out of his place.”

            <p>  Interlude: Where Wisdom Is Found
28 There is a mine for silver
    and a place where gold is refined.
2 Iron is taken from the earth,
    and copper is smelted from ore.
3 Mortals put an end to the darkness;
    they search out the farthest recesses
    for ore in the blackest darkness.
4 Far from human dwellings they cut a shaft,
    in places untouched by human feet;
    far from other people they dangle and sway.
5 The earth, from which food comes,
    is transformed below as by fire;
6 lapis lazuli comes from its rocks,
    and its dust contains nuggets of gold.
7 No bird of prey knows that hidden path,
    no falcon’s eye has seen it.
8 Proud beasts do not set foot on it,
    and no lion prowls there.
9 People assault the flinty rock with their hands
    and lay bare the roots of the mountains.
10 They tunnel through the rock;
    their eyes see all its treasures.
11 They search[a] the sources of the rivers
    and bring hidden things to light.

12 But where can wisdom be found?
    Where does understanding dwell?
13 No mortal comprehends its worth;
    it cannot be found in the land of the living.
14 The deep says, “It is not in me”;
    the sea says, “It is not with me.”
15 It cannot be bought with the finest gold,
    nor can its price be weighed out in silver.
16 It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir,
    with precious onyx or lapis lazuli.
17 Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it,
    nor can it be had for jewels of gold.
18 Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention;
    the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
19 The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it;
    it cannot be bought with pure gold.

20 Where then does wisdom come from?
    Where does understanding dwell?
21 It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing,
    concealed even from the birds in the sky.
22 Destruction[b] and Death say,
    “Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.”
23 God understands the way to it
    and he alone knows where it dwells,
24 for he views the ends of the earth
    and sees everything under the heavens.
25 When he established the force of the wind
    and measured out the waters,
26 when he made a decree for the rain
    and a path for the thunderstorm,
27 then he looked at wisdom and appraised it;
    he confirmed it and tested it.
28 And he said to the human race,
    “The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom,
    and to shun evil is understanding.”

            <p> Job’s Final Defense
29 Job continued his discourse:

2 “How I long for the months gone by,
    for the days when God watched over me,
3 when his lamp shone on my head
    and by his light I walked through darkness!
4 Oh, for the days when I was in my prime,
    when God’s intimate friendship blessed my house,
5 when the Almighty was still with me
    and my children were around me,
6 when my path was drenched with cream
    and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.

7 “When I went to the gate of the city
    and took my seat in the public square,
8 the young men saw me and stepped aside
    and the old men rose to their feet;
9 the chief men refrained from speaking
    and covered their mouths with their hands;
10 the voices of the nobles were hushed,
    and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
11 Whoever heard me spoke well of me,
    and those who saw me commended me,
12 because I rescued the poor who cried for help,
    and the fatherless who had none to assist them.
13 The one who was dying blessed me;
    I made the widow’s heart sing.
14 I put on righteousness as my clothing;
    justice was my robe and my turban.
15 I was eyes to the blind
    and feet to the lame.
16 I was a father to the needy;
    I took up the case of the stranger.
17 I broke the fangs of the wicked
    and snatched the victims from their teeth.

18 “I thought, ‘I will die in my own house,
    my days as numerous as the grains of sand.
19 My roots will reach to the water,
    and the dew will lie all night on my branches.
20 My glory will not fade;
    the bow will be ever new in my hand.’

21 “People listened to me expectantly,
    waiting in silence for my counsel.
22 After I had spoken, they spoke no more;
    my words fell gently on their ears.
23 They waited for me as for showers
    and drank in my words as the spring rain.
24 When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it;
    the light of my face was precious to them.[a]
25 I chose the way for them and sat as their chief;
    I dwelt as a king among his troops;
    I was like one who comforts mourners.

    men younger than I,
whose fathers I would have disdained
    to put with my sheep dogs.
2 Of what use was the strength of their hands to me,
    since their vigor had gone from them?
3 Haggard from want and hunger,
    they roamed[a] the parched land
    in desolate wastelands at night.
4 In the brush they gathered salt herbs,
    and their food[b] was the root of the broom bush.
5 They were banished from human society,
    shouted at as if they were thieves.
6 They were forced to live in the dry stream beds,
    among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
7 They brayed among the bushes
    and huddled in the undergrowth.
8 A base and nameless brood,
    they were driven out of the land.

9 “And now those young men mock me in song;
    I have become a byword among them.
10 They detest me and keep their distance;
    they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
11 Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me,
    they throw off restraint in my presence.
12 On my right the tribe[c] attacks;
    they lay snares for my feet,
    they build their siege ramps against me.
13 They break up my road;
    they succeed in destroying me.
    ‘No one can help him,’ they say.
14 They advance as through a gaping breach;
    amid the ruins they come rolling in.
15 Terrors overwhelm me;
    my dignity is driven away as by the wind,
    my safety vanishes like a cloud.

16 “And now my life ebbs away;
    days of suffering grip me.
17 Night pierces my bones;
    my gnawing pains never rest.
18 In his great power God becomes like clothing to me[d];
    he binds me like the neck of my garment.
19 He throws me into the mud,
    and I am reduced to dust and ashes.

20 “I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer;
    I stand up, but you merely look at me.
21 You turn on me ruthlessly;
    with the might of your hand you attack me.
22 You snatch me up and drive me before the wind;
    you toss me about in the storm.
23 I know you will bring me down to death,
    to the place appointed for all the living.

24 “Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man
    when he cries for help in his distress.
25 Have I not wept for those in trouble?
    Has not my soul grieved for the poor?
26 Yet when I hoped for good, evil came;
    when I looked for light, then came darkness.
27 The churning inside me never stops;
    days of suffering confront me.
28 I go about blackened, but not by the sun;
    I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
29 I have become a brother of jackals,
    a companion of owls.
30 My skin grows black and peels;
    my body burns with fever.
31 My lyre is tuned to mourning,
    and my pipe to the sound of wailing.

2 For what is our lot from God above,
    our heritage from the Almighty on high?
3 Is it not ruin for the wicked,
    disaster for those who do wrong?
4 Does he not see my ways
    and count my every step?

5 “If I have walked with falsehood
    or my foot has hurried after deceit—
6 let God weigh me in honest scales
    and he will know that I am blameless—
7 if my steps have turned from the path,
    if my heart has been led by my eyes,
    or if my hands have been defiled,
8 then may others eat what I have sown,
    and may my crops be uprooted.

9 “If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
    or if I have lurked at my neighbor’s door,
10 then may my wife grind another man’s grain,
    and may other men sleep with her.
11 For that would have been wicked,
    a sin to be judged.
12 It is a fire that burns to Destruction[a];
    it would have uprooted my harvest.

13 “If I have denied justice to any of my servants,
    whether male or female,
    when they had a grievance against me,
14 what will I do when God confronts me?
    What will I answer when called to account?
15 Did not he who made me in the womb make them?
    Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?

16 “If I have denied the desires of the poor
    or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,
17 if I have kept my bread to myself,
    not sharing it with the fatherless—
18 but from my youth I reared them as a father would,
    and from my birth I guided the widow—
19 if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing,
    or the needy without garments,
20 and their hearts did not bless me
    for warming them with the fleece from my sheep,
21 if I have raised my hand against the fatherless,
    knowing that I had influence in court,
22 then let my arm fall from the shoulder,
    let it be broken off at the joint.
23 For I dreaded destruction from God,
    and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.

24 “If I have put my trust in gold
    or said to pure gold, ‘You are my security,’
25 if I have rejoiced over my great wealth,
    the fortune my hands had gained,
26 if I have regarded the sun in its radiance
    or the moon moving in splendor,
27 so that my heart was secretly enticed
    and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,
28 then these also would be sins to be judged,
    for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.

29 “If I have rejoiced at my enemy’s misfortune
    or gloated over the trouble that came to him—
30 I have not allowed my mouth to sin
    by invoking a curse against their life—
31 if those of my household have never said,
    ‘Who has not been filled with Job’s meat?’—
32 but no stranger had to spend the night in the street,
    for my door was always open to the traveler—
33 if I have concealed my sin as people do,[b]
    by hiding my guilt in my heart
34 because I so feared the crowd
    and so dreaded the contempt of the clans
    that I kept silent and would not go outside—

35 (“Oh, that I had someone to hear me!
    I sign now my defense—let the Almighty answer me;
    let my accuser put his indictment in writing.
36 Surely I would wear it on my shoulder,
    I would put it on like a crown.
37 I would give him an account of my every step;
    I would present it to him as to a ruler.)—

38 “if my land cries out against me
    and all its furrows are wet with tears,
39 if I have devoured its yield without payment
    or broken the spirit of its tenants,
40 then let briers come up instead of wheat
    and stinkweed instead of barley.”

32 So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 2 But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God. 3 He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.[a] 4 Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he. 5 But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.

6 So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said:

“I am young in years,
    and you are old;
that is why I was fearful,
    not daring to tell you what I know.
7 I thought, ‘Age should speak;
    advanced years should teach wisdom.’
8 But it is the spirit[b] in a person,
    the breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.
9 It is not only the old[c] who are wise,
    not only the aged who understand what is right.

10 “Therefore I say: Listen to me;
    I too will tell you what I know.
11 I waited while you spoke,
    I listened to your reasoning;
while you were searching for words,
12     I gave you my full attention.
But not one of you has proved Job wrong;
    none of you has answered his arguments.
13 Do not say, ‘We have found wisdom;
    let God, not a man, refute him.’
14 But Job has not marshaled his words against me,
    and I will not answer him with your arguments.

15 “They are dismayed and have no more to say;
    words have failed them.
16 Must I wait, now that they are silent,
    now that they stand there with no reply?
17 I too will have my say;
    I too will tell what I know.
18 For I am full of words,
    and the spirit within me compels me;
19 inside I am like bottled-up wine,
    like new wineskins ready to burst.
20 I must speak and find relief;
    I must open my lips and reply.
21 I will show no partiality,
    nor will I flatter anyone;
22 for if I were skilled in flattery,
    my Maker would soon take me away.

            <p>  33 “But now, Job, listen to my words;
    pay attention to everything I say.
2 I am about to open my mouth;
    my words are on the tip of my tongue.
3 My words come from an upright heart;
    my lips sincerely speak what I know.
4 The Spirit of God has made me;
    the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
5 Answer me then, if you can;
    stand up and argue your case before me.
6 I am the same as you in God’s sight;
    I too am a piece of clay.
7 No fear of me should alarm you,
    nor should my hand be heavy on you.

8 “But you have said in my hearing—
    I heard the very words—
9 ‘I am pure, I have done no wrong;
    I am clean and free from sin.
10 Yet God has found fault with me;
    he considers me his enemy.
11 He fastens my feet in shackles;
    he keeps close watch on all my paths.’

12 “But I tell you, in this you are not right,
    for God is greater than any mortal.
13 Why do you complain to him
    that he responds to no one’s words[a]?
14 For God does speak—now one way, now another—
    though no one perceives it.
15 In a dream, in a vision of the night,
    when deep sleep falls on people
    as they slumber in their beds,
16 he may speak in their ears
    and terrify them with warnings,
17 to turn them from wrongdoing
    and keep them from pride,
18 to preserve them from the pit,
    their lives from perishing by the sword.[b]

19 “Or someone may be chastened on a bed of pain
    with constant distress in their bones,
20 so that their body finds food repulsive
    and their soul loathes the choicest meal.
21 Their flesh wastes away to nothing,
    and their bones, once hidden, now stick out.
22 They draw near to the pit,
    and their life to the messengers of death.[c]
23 Yet if there is an angel at their side,
    a messenger, one out of a thousand,
    sent to tell them how to be upright,
24 and he is gracious to that person and says to God,
    ‘Spare them from going down to the pit;
    I have found a ransom for them—
25 let their flesh be renewed like a child’s;
    let them be restored as in the days of their youth’—
26 then that person can pray to God and find favor with him,
    they will see God’s face and shout for joy;
    he will restore them to full well-being.
27 And they will go to others and say,
    ‘I have sinned, I have perverted what is right,
    but I did not get what I deserved.
28 God has delivered me from going down to the pit,
    and I shall live to enjoy the light of life.’

29 “God does all these things to a person—
    twice, even three times—
30 to turn them back from the pit,
    that the light of life may shine on them.

31 “Pay attention, Job, and listen to me;
    be silent, and I will speak.
32 If you have anything to say, answer me;
    speak up, for I want to vindicate you.
33 But if not, then listen to me;
    be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”

         <h2 className={styles.thirdchapter}> Job Chapter XXXIV</h2>
            <p>  34 Then Elihu said:

2 “Hear my words, you wise men;
    listen to me, you men of learning.
3 For the ear tests words
    as the tongue tastes food.
4 Let us discern for ourselves what is right;
    let us learn together what is good.

5 “Job says, ‘I am innocent,
    but God denies me justice.
6 Although I am right,
    I am considered a liar;
although I am guiltless,
    his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.’
7 Is there anyone like Job,
    who drinks scorn like water?
8 He keeps company with evildoers;
    he associates with the wicked.
9 For he says, ‘There is no profit
    in trying to please God.’

10 “So listen to me, you men of understanding.
    Far be it from God to do evil,
    from the Almighty to do wrong.
11 He repays everyone for what they have done;
    he brings on them what their conduct deserves.
12 It is unthinkable that God would do wrong,
    that the Almighty would pervert justice.
13 Who appointed him over the earth?
    Who put him in charge of the whole world?
14 If it were his intention
    and he withdrew his spirit[a] and breath,
15 all humanity would perish together
    and mankind would return to the dust.

16 “If you have understanding, hear this;
    listen to what I say.
17 Can someone who hates justice govern?
    Will you condemn the just and mighty One?
18 Is he not the One who says to kings, ‘You are worthless,’
    and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’
19 who shows no partiality to princes
    and does not favor the rich over the poor,
    for they are all the work of his hands?
20 They die in an instant, in the middle of the night;
    the people are shaken and they pass away;
    the mighty are removed without human hand.

21 “His eyes are on the ways of mortals;
    he sees their every step.
22 There is no deep shadow, no utter darkness,
    where evildoers can hide.
23 God has no need to examine people further,
    that they should come before him for judgment.
24 Without inquiry he shatters the mighty
    and sets up others in their place.
25 Because he takes note of their deeds,
    he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
26 He punishes them for their wickedness
    where everyone can see them,
27 because they turned from following him
    and had no regard for any of his ways.
28 They caused the cry of the poor to come before him,
    so that he heard the cry of the needy.
29 But if he remains silent, who can condemn him?
    If he hides his face, who can see him?
Yet he is over individual and nation alike,
30     to keep the godless from ruling,
    from laying snares for the people.

31 “Suppose someone says to God,
    ‘I am guilty but will offend no more.
32 Teach me what I cannot see;
    if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.’
33 Should God then reward you on your terms,
    when you refuse to repent?
You must decide, not I;
    so tell me what you know.

34 “Men of understanding declare,
    wise men who hear me say to me,
35 ‘Job speaks without knowledge;
    his words lack insight.’
36 Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost
    for answering like a wicked man!
37 To his sin he adds rebellion;
    scornfully he claps his hands among us
    and multiplies his words against God.”

         <h2 className={styles.thirdchapter}> Job Chapter XXXV</h2>
            <p>  35 Then Elihu said:

2 “Do you think this is just?
    You say, ‘I am in the right, not God.’
3 Yet you ask him, ‘What profit is it to me,[a]
    and what do I gain by not sinning?’

4 “I would like to reply to you
    and to your friends with you.
5 Look up at the heavens and see;
    gaze at the clouds so high above you.
6 If you sin, how does that affect him?
    If your sins are many, what does that do to him?
7 If you are righteous, what do you give to him,
    or what does he receive from your hand?
8 Your wickedness only affects humans like yourself,
    and your righteousness only other people.

9 “People cry out under a load of oppression;
    they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
10 But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,
    who gives songs in the night,
11 who teaches us more than he teaches[b] the beasts of the earth
    and makes us wiser than[c] the birds in the sky?’
12 He does not answer when people cry out
    because of the arrogance of the wicked.
13 Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea;
    the Almighty pays no attention to it.
14 How much less, then, will he listen
    when you say that you do not see him,
that your case is before him
    and you must wait for him,
15 and further, that his anger never punishes
    and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.[d]
16 So Job opens his mouth with empty talk;
    without knowledge he multiplies words.”

            <p> 36 Elihu continued:

2 “Bear with me a little longer and I will show you
    that there is more to be said in God’s behalf.
3 I get my knowledge from afar;
    I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
4 Be assured that my words are not false;
    one who has perfect knowledge is with you.

5 “God is mighty, but despises no one;
    he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.
6 He does not keep the wicked alive
    but gives the afflicted their rights.
7 He does not take his eyes off the righteous;
    he enthrones them with kings
    and exalts them forever.
8 But if people are bound in chains,
    held fast by cords of affliction,
9 he tells them what they have done—
    that they have sinned arrogantly.
10 He makes them listen to correction
    and commands them to repent of their evil.
11 If they obey and serve him,
    they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity
    and their years in contentment.
12 But if they do not listen,
    they will perish by the sword[a]
    and die without knowledge.

13 “The godless in heart harbor resentment;
    even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.
14 They die in their youth,
    among male prostitutes of the shrines.
15 But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering;
    he speaks to them in their affliction.

16 “He is wooing you from the jaws of distress
    to a spacious place free from restriction,
    to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.
17 But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked;
    judgment and justice have taken hold of you.
18 Be careful that no one entices you by riches;
    do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
19 Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts
    sustain you so you would not be in distress?
20 Do not long for the night,
    to drag people away from their homes.[b]
21 Beware of turning to evil,
    which you seem to prefer to affliction.

22 “God is exalted in his power.
    Who is a teacher like him?
23 Who has prescribed his ways for him,
    or said to him, ‘You have done wrong’?
24 Remember to extol his work,
    which people have praised in song.
25 All humanity has seen it;
    mortals gaze on it from afar.
26 How great is God—beyond our understanding!
    The number of his years is past finding out.

27 “He draws up the drops of water,
    which distill as rain to the streams[c];
28 the clouds pour down their moisture
    and abundant showers fall on mankind.
29 Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds,
    how he thunders from his pavilion?
30 See how he scatters his lightning about him,
    bathing the depths of the sea.
31 This is the way he governs[d] the nations
    and provides food in abundance.
32 He fills his hands with lightning
    and commands it to strike its mark.
33 His thunder announces the coming storm;
    even the cattle make known its approach.

37 “At this my heart pounds
    and leaps from its place.
2 Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice,
    to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
3 He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven
    and sends it to the ends of the earth.
4 After that comes the sound of his roar;
    he thunders with his majestic voice.
When his voice resounds,
    he holds nothing back.
5 God’s voice thunders in marvelous ways;
    he does great things beyond our understanding.
6 He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’
    and to the rain shower, ‘Be a mighty downpour.’
7 So that everyone he has made may know his work,
    he stops all people from their labor.[a]
8 The animals take cover;
    they remain in their dens.
9 The tempest comes out from its chamber,
    the cold from the driving winds.
10 The breath of God produces ice,
    and the broad waters become frozen.
11 He loads the clouds with moisture;
    he scatters his lightning through them.
12 At his direction they swirl around
    over the face of the whole earth
    to do whatever he commands them.
13 He brings the clouds to punish people,
    or to water his earth and show his love.

14 “Listen to this, Job;
    stop and consider God’s wonders.
15 Do you know how God controls the clouds
    and makes his lightning flash?
16 Do you know how the clouds hang poised,
    those wonders of him who has perfect knowledge?
17 You who swelter in your clothes
    when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
18 can you join him in spreading out the skies,
    hard as a mirror of cast bronze?

19 “Tell us what we should say to him;
    we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.
20 Should he be told that I want to speak?
    Would anyone ask to be swallowed up?
21 Now no one can look at the sun,
    bright as it is in the skies
    after the wind has swept them clean.
22 Out of the north he comes in golden splendor;
    God comes in awesome majesty.
23 The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power;
    in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.
24 Therefore, people revere him,
    for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?

            <p>  The Lord Speaks
38 Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm. He said:

2 “Who is this that obscures my plans
    with words without knowledge?
3 Brace yourself like a man;
    I will question you,
    and you shall answer me.

4 “Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
    Tell me, if you understand.
5 Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!
    Who stretched a measuring line across it?
6 On what were its footings set,
    or who laid its cornerstone—
7 while the morning stars sang together
    and all the angels[a] shouted for joy?

8 “Who shut up the sea behind doors
    when it burst forth from the womb,
9 when I made the clouds its garment
    and wrapped it in thick darkness,
10 when I fixed limits for it
    and set its doors and bars in place,
11 when I said, ‘This far you may come and no farther;
    here is where your proud waves halt’?

12 “Have you ever given orders to the morning,
    or shown the dawn its place,
13 that it might take the earth by the edges
    and shake the wicked out of it?
14 The earth takes shape like clay under a seal;
    its features stand out like those of a garment.
15 The wicked are denied their light,
    and their upraised arm is broken.

16 “Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea
    or walked in the recesses of the deep?
17 Have the gates of death been shown to you?
    Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness?
18 Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth?
    Tell me, if you know all this.

19 “What is the way to the abode of light?
    And where does darkness reside?
20 Can you take them to their places?
    Do you know the paths to their dwellings?
21 Surely you know, for you were already born!
    You have lived so many years!

22 “Have you entered the storehouses of the snow
    or seen the storehouses of the hail,
23 which I reserve for times of trouble,
    for days of war and battle?
24 What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed,
    or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?
25 Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain,
    and a path for the thunderstorm,
26 to water a land where no one lives,
    an uninhabited desert,
27 to satisfy a desolate wasteland
    and make it sprout with grass?
28 Does the rain have a father?
    Who fathers the drops of dew?
29 From whose womb comes the ice?
    Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens
30 when the waters become hard as stone,
    when the surface of the deep is frozen?

31 “Can you bind the chains[b] of the Pleiades?
    Can you loosen Orion’s belt?
32 Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons[c]
    or lead out the Bear[d] with its cubs?
33 Do you know the laws of the heavens?
    Can you set up God’s[e] dominion over the earth?

34 “Can you raise your voice to the clouds
    and cover yourself with a flood of water?
35 Do you send the lightning bolts on their way?
    Do they report to you, ‘Here we are’?
36 Who gives the ibis wisdom[f]
    or gives the rooster understanding?[g]
37 Who has the wisdom to count the clouds?
    Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens
38 when the dust becomes hard
    and the clods of earth stick together?

39 “Do you hunt the prey for the lioness
    and satisfy the hunger of the lions
40 when they crouch in their dens
    or lie in wait in a thicket?
41 Who provides food for the raven
    when its young cry out to God

3 They crouch down and bring forth their young;
    their labor pains are ended.
4 Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds;
    they leave and do not return.

5 “Who let the wild donkey go free?
    Who untied its ropes?
6 I gave it the wasteland as its home,
    the salt flats as its habitat.
7 It laughs at the commotion in the town;

16 She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers;
    she cares not that her labor was in vain,
17 for God did not endow her with wisdom
    or give her a share of good sense.
18 Yet when she spreads her feathers to run,
    she laughs at horse and rider.

19 “Do you give the horse its strength
    or clothe its neck with a flowing mane?
20 Do you make it leap like a locust,
    striking terror with its proud snorting?
21 It paws fiercely, rejoicing in its strength,
    and charges into the fray.
22 It laughs at fear, afraid of nothing;
    it does not shy away from the sword.
23 The quiver rattles against its side,
    along with the flashing spear and lance.
24 In frenzied excitement it eats up the ground;
    it cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.
25 At the blast of the trumpet it snorts, ‘Aha!’
    It catches the scent of battle from afar,
    the shout of commanders and the battle cry.

26 “Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom
    and spread its wings toward the south?
27 Does the eagle soar at your command
    and build its nest on high?
28 It dwells on a cliff and stays there at night;
    a rocky crag is its stronghold.
29 From there it looks for food;
    its eyes detect it from afar.
30 Its young ones feast on blood,
    and where the slain are, there it is.”

    and flames dart from its mouth.
22 Strength resides in its neck;
    dismay goes before it.
23 The folds of its flesh are tightly joined;
    they are firm and immovable.
24 Its chest is hard as rock,
    hard as a lower millstone.
25 When it rises up, the mighty are terrified;
    they retreat before its thrashing.
26 The sword that reaches it has no effect,
    nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.
27 Iron it treats like straw
    and bronze like rotten wood.
28 Arrows do not make it flee;
    slingstones are like chaff to it.
29 A club seems to it but a piece of straw;
    it laughs at the rattling of the lance.
30 Its undersides are jagged potsherds,
    leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.
31 It makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron
    and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
32 It leaves a glistening wake behind it;
    one would think the deep had white hair.
33 Nothing on earth is its equal—
    a creature without fear.
34 It looks down on all that are haughty;
    it is king over all that are proud.”

            <p>   
Job
42 Then Job replied to the Lord:

2 “I know that you can do all things;
    no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
3 You asked, ‘Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?’
    Surely I spoke of things I did not understand,
    things too wonderful for me to know.

4 “You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak;
    I will question you,
    and you shall answer me.’
5 My ears had heard of you
    but now my eyes have seen you.
6 Therefore I despise myself
    and repent in dust and ashes.”

Epilogue
7 After the Lord had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has. 8 So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.” 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the Lord told them; and the Lord accepted Job’s prayer.

10 After Job had prayed for his friends, the Lord restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before. 11 All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the Lord had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver[a] and a gold ring.

12 The Lord blessed the latter part of Job’s life more than the former part. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys. 13 And he also had seven sons and three daughters. 14 The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch. 15 Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.

16 After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. 17 And so Job died, an old man and full of years.
